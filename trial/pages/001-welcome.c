/* Bold format, ease of conversion: I have set up this site so that it is easy to write blog posts, focusing solely on the intuition of the math concepts I have learnt. I have set it up so that it is easy to convert it to an anki deck with my current script. I have actually ported over a lot of Anki notes over. The challenge now is how to make coherent blog posts out of these notes. This is my attempt at fitting all these in context, generating a script to fix my Anki deck. */
