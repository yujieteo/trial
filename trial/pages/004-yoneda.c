/* Yoneda's lemma, probe function perspective:  One perspective one can take on the Yoneda lemma is to look at probes. I think Vakil made this analogy where you basically understand all morphisms of the form Hom(-, M) when you want to study object M, and - can represent any object related to object M in the category. The particle collider (assuming complete knowledge of all particles. This is akin how Cayley's theorem invoking the closure of groups) can test an unknown particle with every other particle. If you know this result, then you basically fully determine the particle. This set of morphisms (morphisms are important here since composition of morphisms are morphisms) is a representation (a representation is thought of as a functor) of the object M. */
/* Yoneda's lemma, definition of right Kan extensions:  one can take about the Yoneda lemma is to define the right Kan extension of a functor F from a category C to a category E along a functor K. We start by needing the definition of a pointwise Kan extension. The motivation if a pointwise Kan extension is to preserve representable functors. The motivation of representable functors is to have the functor of points analogy. Then, the right Kan extension is pointwise if this limit exists and is isomorphic to a morphism d in category C. */
/* Ideals, Yoneda embedding for posets:   Dedekind constructed the reals from the rationals, one embeds the rationals in its power set by defining the representative set (known as a Dedekind cut) using the least upper bound of the rationals as the Yoneda embedding on the poset of the rationals. This is an order preserving injection, you can work with these sets instead of the original rational numbers. The similar idea is to consider ideal sets where you have powers of rationals bounded by an integer, then embed the divisibility relation. For example, define the analogous Dedekind cut S_x by elements a in the integers adjoined the square root of negative 5 such that x divides a. Now take the kernel under homomorphisms from this field extension into an integral domain. One obtains ideals this way. See Qiaochu Yuan's blog post on primes and ideals. */
/* Yoneda's lemma, category of schemes have all fibre products:  here is a proof sketch from Hartshorne with two key steps. Recall that this statement is to check that the fibre product of the scheme Spec A and scheme Spec B (think of these as prime spectra) over a base scheme Spec R, where R is a commutative ring is isomorphic to the scheme of the tensor product over the ring R for commutative rings A and B. The proof follows two steps, the case of affines schemes, one can appeal to the universal property of the fibre product of schemes, and pass it through to the tensor product of rings via the algebra-geometry duality, and then use Yoneda's lemma to show that this is a unique representing object given the fibres. Next, on the level of schemes, consider at least affine covers (we did not state the nature of the covers here) of schemes X, Y, and affine scheme S, (other schemes to consider the fibre product of X and Y), then cover them the fibre products of S and S_j indexed. These are affine, the fibre product exists and unique, due to the nature of sheafification, descent, and glueing, one can construct the unique fibre product for arbitrary schemes over the base scheme Spec S. */
/* Cayley's theorem, the Yoneda embedding:  the symmetric group is the cofinal object for the indexed collection of its subgroups. Once you understand Cayley's Theorem, you understand the basic idea of the proof for the Yoneda embedding and Yoneda's lemma. Note, not trivial, requires key step. Consider underlying element of group x, mapping to left action gx. It is important to note tht groups are closed under the group law, so this is bijection, since this is a bijection on the same set. It is a permutation, so groups must be isomorphic to permutation groups (or subgroups of symmetric groups) under composition of permutations. Yoneda's lemma is similar, considering homset(b, a) mapping to natural transformations nat(hom(a, -), hom(b, -)). This must be an isomorphism, since compositions of morphisms are morphisms (we used the assumption of a locally small category here, this is large enough to only form a set). Therefore, define this as an Yoneda embedding (if on sets), and all small categories are embed into the category of functors of defined on that categories, which are represented by pre-sheaves or representable functors. */
/* Row operations, naturality comes from Yoneda's lemma:  the requirement that it must be elementary row operations, these are the natural transformations between matrices i.e. swapping two columns, multiplication by scalars, scalar multiples of one column to another are invertible since corresponding elementary matrices are invertible. An non-example includes appending a column to 1s. Applying this to identity matrix fails, then right multiplication defines different column operation, this is because this is not an elementary row operation, fails invertibility. */
/* Functor of points, in contrast to Yoneda's lemma:  classically, the functor of points, denoted  Hom(-, X), is a functor from (Affine schemes)^op to Set, sending affine scheme Y to set of scheme maps Y -> X. Therefore, a scheme is the representing object of the functor of points, the functor of points is a representable functor. The Yoneda lemma is, in contrast, weaker, consider the case where Hom(-, X), Schemes^op -> Set, where X is a scheme. The functor of points requires it sufficient to be an isomorphism to functor of points, and not necessarily the natural transformations. This functor Hom(-, X) classifies geometric objects over Y given by F. The notion is analogous to classifying space. */
/* Isomorphisms, cardinality as a consideration in the Yoneda lemma:  naturality concerns how to preserve cardinality. This is why the Yoneda lemma is a forgetful functor into the category of sets. More details can be found in Lawvere's book on Conceptual Mathematics. */
/* Yoneda's lemma, presheaves as a generalised object:  Yoneda's lemma enable this powerful interpretation of a presheaf as some form of a generalised object. Recall that a presheaf is a contravariant functor from the opposite category C^op to the category of sets. A generalised object is an object that can be probed by ordinary objects. We can consider a presheaf as something that assigns each test object U in the category C, to a set of U-points of F(U), this is not dissimilar to thinking about functionals. Each object X in the category C determines a representable presheaf (with the object X in the category C a representing object), we have h_x = Hom_C(-, X) from the opposite category C^op to the category of sets. The Yoneda's lemma guarantees that h_x and X are the same objects. This functoriality is fully faithful, distinct objects and maps in the category C remain distinct as presheaves. The next important assertion is that presheaves freely add all colimits (free cocomplete category), therefore any functor from category C to category D with category D cocomplete extends uniquely up to isomorphism a colimit preserving functor. The Yoneda lemma is a categorification of the statement that the canonical map from a set S to its free commutative monoid N(S) is injective (distinct generators remain distinct in the free object). */
/* Field extensions (Galois theory), Yoneda extensions as left Kan extension along a Yoneda embedding:  the idea is you have a smaller field in a larger field, Galois theory uses this to define field extensions. Similarly, a Yoneda extension is the left Kan extension along a Yoneda embedding. */
/* Projective object, statement of the Yoneda lemma in terms of projective objects:  the definition lends itself to a neat restatement of the Yoneda lemma, a projective object is an object for which every epimorphism and morphism there exists a lift, or Hom(P, -) preserves epimorphisms. Apply this to presheaves and Hom(h_X, -) is known as the the evaluation functor on X, this preserves epimorphisms (as a projective object) and we think about epimorphisms in a presheaf category as pointwise surjective natural transformations, the conclusion is therefore representables in the functor category are projective objects. An intuition: projective objects are the “free generators” of a category since morphisms out of them are easy to define, and they detect surjectivity. Yoneda's lemma then says that every natural transformation out of a representable is completely determined by its value on the objects. Replacing the category of sets here enable definitions of projective resolutions from representables and considerations about the derived categories. */
/* Points of sets, clarified with the Yoneda's lemma:  this is a very number theory flavoured argument when one consider the natural numbers (excluding 0, including initial object 1) as a poset, there is natural transformation from the constant functor to Hom(-, X) or 1 -> X in this clearer notation, Nat(1 -> X, !) is canonically isomorphic to hom-set of hom-sets Hom(Hom(1, X), !). Therefore, a point of set X is a map from the initial object 1 to X. This example clarifies that much of category theory rests on poset structure on the natural numbers. */
/* Representations, an intepretation of the Yoneda's lemma in terms of the representing homset of homsets:  Yoneda's lemma and representation theory, simply says that natural transformations are represented by the homset of homsets from objects to functors i.e. Nat(h_A, F) is represented by Hom(Hom(A, -), F), for object A in category C, F any functor. So natural transformations are always representable by the algebra of hom-sets under any functor from (LOCALLY SMALL) category from C to Set, locally small means set's worth of arrows locally, there is no monkey business with large cardinalities. */
/* Yoneda's lemma, defining set level isomorphisms:  Yoneda's lemma implies a composition of two morphisms between two sets of objects whose composition and inverse identify in their respective sets of objects called a isomorphism. This isomorphism is canonical and unique, and is between the value of a presheaf X at a morphism c and the collection of all morphisms (hom-set) of presheaf homomorphisms from the representable presheaf y(c) to the presheaf X. This means Hom_{Set^{C^op}}(y(c), X) is isomorphic to X(c). */
/* Yoneda lemma, a scheme can be thought of as a geometric space, but one that is best described not by its "points" in the classical sense, but by all the possible ways to "map into it" from other simpler spaces. Imagine a scheme X as a complex, geometric object. Instead of trying to define its points directly, we describe it by its "blueprint for observation." This blueprint tells us, for any simple 'probe' space like the affine line A1, what the set of all possible maps from that probe to our scheme X looks like. The Yoneda lemma guarantees that this collection of maps from all possible probe spaces uniquely and completely defines the original scheme X. For example, the affine line A1 is fully characterized by the functor that sends a ring R to the set of elements in R, which corresponds to the set of morphisms from Spec(R) to A1:  The Yoneda lemma provides the foundation for the "functor of points" perspective. A scheme X can be fully understood by the functor it represents, namely the functor Hom(_,X):Sch^op to Set, which maps a scheme T to the set of morphisms of schemes from T to X. The Yoneda lemma says that knowing the functor of points is equivalent to knowing the scheme itself. */
/* Yoneda lemma, a module M as a vector space over a non-commutative ring R. Instead of looking at the elements of M directly, we can understand M by observing how it "interacts" with all other modules. Imagine a module M as a black box. The only way to probe this box is by sending in homomorphisms from other modules, say N_1​,N_2​,…. The set of all possible maps from a module N to M is Hom_R​(N,M). The Yoneda lemma says that the entire collection of these sets, for all possible N, gives us a complete and unique "fingerprint" of the module M. For example, the left ideal R itself (as a left R-module) is uniquely determined by the functor Hom_R​(R,−) which is just the identity functor:  for a non-commutative ring R, the category of left R-modules, R-Mod, is a fundamental object of study. The Yoneda lemma applied to R-Mod states that for any left R-module M, the contravariant functor HomR​(M,_):R-Mod→Set uniquely determines M up to isomorphism. */
/* Yoneda lemma, for an object A and an object B. We are building a new, "extended" object E that sits in the middle of a short exact sequence 0 to B to E to A to 0. We can visualize this sequence as building a composite object E by "gluing" B to A in a particular way. The Yoneda lemma provides a way to classify these different "gluing" methods. It says that the collection of all possible extensions of A by B is uniquely determined by the "maps out of A" in a higher-order sense, specifically by the functor that assigns to each module X the group Ext^1(A,X). This perspective shifts the focus from the individual object E to the entire family of all possible extensions. The Yoneda lemma is the reason we can interpret Ext^1 in this geometric way:  The Yoneda lemma is crucial for defining and understanding Ext groups. The Ext group Ext^1(A,B) classifies extensions of A by B. The Yoneda lemma provides a powerful lens: Ext^1(A,B) can be interpreted as the set of isomorphism classes of exact sequences 0 to B to E to A to 0. */
/* Yoneda lemma, imagine a topological space X as a piece of rubber. Instead of describing its points and how they're connected, we can understand it by how it "receives" other shapes. For example, we can test it by seeing how many ways a circle, a sphere, or a torus can be continuously mapped into it. The Yoneda lemma guarantees that the entire collection of these test maps, for every possible simple shape, gives us a full and complete description of our original rubber shape, up to continuous deformation. This is why we can study spaces by studying their "probes." For example, the homotopy groups of a space pi_(X) are defined as maps from the sphere S^n to X, and the Yoneda lemma gives us a reason why studying these maps is a powerful way to understand the space X:  In homotopy theory, the Yoneda lemma states that a space X is completely determined by the collection of all continuous maps from other spaces into it, i.e., by its functor of points Hom_{Top}​(_,X):Top^op→Set. The homotopy category, where objects are topological spaces and morphisms are homotopy classes of maps, also provides a key application. The Yoneda lemma in this context asserts that the homotopy type of a space X is determined by the functor it represents. */
/* Yoneda lemma, arithmetic number theory, imagine a ring of integers O_K​ of a number field K as an "arithmetic space." We can understand this space not by directly listing its elements, but by seeing how it "looks" through the lens of other rings. For example, if we probe it with the ring of integers Z, the maps are just the inclusions of Z into O_K​. If we probe it with a finite field F_p​, the maps reveal the prime ideals of O_K​ lying over p. The Yoneda lemma says that this collection of "probe results," from all possible rings, completely defines the arithmetic structure of OK​. For example, the ring of integers Z[root(−5)] is uniquely defined by its functor of points which maps a ring R to the set of elements x in R such that x^2 + 5 = 0:  In number theory, the Yoneda lemma is implicitly used in the study of schemes and their points. For a number field K, the ring of integers O_K​ is an object in the category of rings. The scheme Spec(O_K​) is then studied via its functor of points, which maps a ring R to the set of ring homomorphisms Hom(O_K​,R). The Yoneda lemma assures us that this functor uniquely defines the ring of integers. */
/* Yoneda lemma, a group G acting on a vector space V over a field k. This action is a representation. We can think of this representation not as the specific vector space V, but as a "recipe" for how G can act. The Yoneda lemma tells us that this recipe is fully encoded by how V "connects" to every other representation. For example, if we have a simple representation S, the maps from S to V (which form the set Hom_{kG​}(S,V)) tell us about the composition factors of V. The Yoneda lemma guarantees that by knowing all these maps for all possible representations, we know our original representation V completely:  in modular representation theory, we study representations of a finite group G over a field k of characteristic p (where pdivides the order of G). A key tool is the category of kG-modules. The Yoneda lemma states that a kG-module M is uniquely determined by the functor Hom_{kG​}(M, _): kG-Mod to Set. */
/* Yoneda lemma, imagine a smooth manifold as a geometric object that is locally Euclidean. The Yoneda lemma says that we can understand this manifold completely by looking at all the possible smooth maps from other simpler manifolds into it. For example, to understand a 2-sphere S^2, we don't just look at its points. We can fully describe it by considering all the smooth maps from the real line R, which correspond to smooth curves on the sphere. The collection of all possible smooth curves on the sphere, for instance, gives us a complete "database" of how the sphere behaves smoothly, and the Yoneda lemma guarantees this is enough to define the sphere itself:  in differential geometry, the category of smooth manifolds can be studied using the Yoneda lemma. A smooth manifold M is determined by the functor of points Hom(_,M):Man^{op} to Set, where we consider smooth maps. */
/* Yoneda lemma, imagine a commutative ring A as a collection of properties (its elements, its ideals, its prime ideals). The Yoneda lemma says we can understand this ring entirely by observing how it "maps into" other rings. For instance, we can map A into the field of fractions Frac(A), which tells us about its invertible elements. We can map it into a finite ring Z_n​, which tells us about its characteristic and zero-divisors. The Yoneda lemma says that if we have a complete record of all these maps, we have a unique and complete description of the ring A itself:  The Yoneda lemma is fundamental to the category-theoretic view of commutative algebra. A ring A is uniquely determined by the functor it represents, Hom_{CRing}​(A,_). This functor maps a ring B to the set of ring homomorphisms from A to B. */
/* Yoneda lemma, a vector bundle can be visualized as a manifold with a vector space attached to each point. For example, the tangent bundle of a sphere is the collection of all tangent planes at every point. The Yoneda lemma says that we can understand this object completely by considering all possible "sections" of it from other manifolds. For example, to understand the tangent bundle of a sphere, we can consider smooth vector fields on the sphere. These are maps from the sphere to its tangent bundle, a specific type of section. The Yoneda lemma suggests that studying the totality of all possible "vector fields" on the sphere (and from other manifolds) is equivalent to studying the tangent bundle itself: A vector bundle E to M over a manifold M can be understood in terms of its functor of points. The Yoneda lemma implies that the isomorphism class of the vector bundle is determined by the functor that assigns to each manifold N the set of vector bundle maps from the trivial bundle over N to the bundle E. */
/* Yoneda lemma, a group scheme as a geometric space (like an elliptic curve) that also has a group law on its points. For an elliptic curve, this group law corresponds to adding points on the curve. The Yoneda lemma says that we can understand this geometric-group object by looking at how its points interact with points from other spaces. For example, for an elliptic curve E, the set of points with coordinates in a field k (the set E(k)) forms an abelian group. The Yoneda lemma says that the collection of these groups for all possible fields k (and other rings) perfectly defines the elliptic curve itself, including its group structure: a group scheme is a scheme G together with morphisms (multiplication, inverse, identity) that make the functor of points Hom(−,G) a functor to the category of groups. The Yoneda lemma ensures that this functorial structure precisely determines the geometric structure of the group scheme. */
/* Yoneda lemma, for a simple discrete dynamical system on a finite set X={1,2,3,4} with the map f(x)=x^2(mod5). We can visualize this as a directed graph where an arrow from x to y means f(x)=y. The Yoneda lemma says that we can understand this entire graph structure by looking at how it "probes" other sets with a similar structure. For example, we can map our system to another one. The Yoneda lemma says that this is the same as mapping a single point of our original graph, which is the starting point of a trajectory. The entire dynamical system is determined by where this "single starting point" can go:  in a discrete dynamical system, we have a set X and a map f: X to X. We can view this as a category with objects being elements of X and a single morphism from x to f(x). The Yoneda lemma can be used to understand the structure of this system by examining the functor it represents. */
/* Yoneda lemma, a sheaf can be visualized as a collection of "local data" (sections) that are glued together in a consistent way. For example, the sheaf of regular functions on an affine scheme is given by the ring itself. The Yoneda lemma says that we can understand this complex, glued-together object by looking at all its "global sections." For example, the global sections of a sheaf on an affine scheme X = Spec(A) give us back the ring A itself. The Yoneda lemma guarantees that this process of "probing" the sheaf with open sets and looking at its sections is equivalent to knowing the entire sheaf: a quasi-coherent sheaf of modules F on a scheme X can be fully understood by the functor it represents, which maps an open set U in X to the set of sections F(U). The Yoneda lemma ensures that this functor uniquely determines the sheaf. */
/* Yoneda lemma, imagine two simple representations, S_1​ and S_2​, as two completely "irreducible" and "indivisible" geometric shapes. Schur's Lemma says that the only way to map one of these shapes into the other is to either scale it perfectly (an isomorphism) or to collapse it to a single point (the zero map). The Yoneda lemma gives a deep reason for this: because S1_​ and S_2​ are so fundamental, they only "see" each other in the simplest possible ways. If a map from S_1​ to S_2​ exists, it is determined by where the single "identity" element of S_1​ goes. This one point either maps to zero or to a non-zero point, which by the simplicity of S_2​ must generate the whole space. This forces the map to be either zero or an isomorphism:  for simple representations, Schur's Lemma states that any homomorphism between two simple modules is either an isomorphism or the zero map. This can be viewed as a consequence of the Yoneda lemma. The Yoneda lemma says that the set of homomorphisms from a simple module S to any module M, Hom_{kG​}(S,M), can be understood as the set of "probe points" of M corresponding to S. */
/* Yoneda lemma, for cohomology groups of a topological space are like a set of "holes" of different dimensions. For example, a torus has one 1-dimensional hole and one 2-dimensional hole. The Yoneda lemma says that we can understand these "holes" not by just looking at the space itself, but by looking at how other spaces can "wrap around" these holes. The Yoneda lemma guarantees that the functor that sends a group A to the cohomology group H^n(X,A) uniquely determines the "n-dimensional holes" of X:  in algebraic topology, the cohomology of a space X with coefficients in an abelian group A, H^∗(X,A), is defined using a cochain complex built from X. The Yoneda lemma provides a way to see that the cohomology functor H^n(X,−) is uniquely determined by the object it represents in the homotopy category of chain complexes, which is the cochain complex of X. */
