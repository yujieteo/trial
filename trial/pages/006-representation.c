/* Irreducible representation, quick definition of abelian group:  an abelian group is a group where all irreducible representations of G have degree 1. The key step for a possible proof is: define g be order of G, h is number of classes of h, (n_1, ..., n_h) be degrees of distinct irreducible representations of g, g = sum of square powers of n_i and is only equal to h (using abelian condition) if and only if all n_i are equal to 1 */
/* Cartan subgroups, Langlands functorality:  representations of the general linear group corresponds to representations of Cartan subgroups. */
/* Semisimple, exclude abelian groups:   for example you do not want unipotent subgroups to be counted as a Cartan subgroup */
/* Cofinal, Yoneda object as representative: a collection of finite groups is cofinal if all of the groups in this collection embeds into one of them. Cayley's theorem can then be stated as the collection of finite symmetric groups is cofinal. This is categorically flavored, as the cofinal object is the most free (sort of) object where forgetting parts of the cofinal object gives the relation you want. The cofinal object is an representing object. */
/* Yoneda lemma, enabling a proof sketch for G being isomorphic to the automorphism group of forgetful functors of GSet to Set demonsrating Tannaka duality for G-sets:   this is like Cayley's theorem, let C as SetG (maps from G to Set) or GSet, and we have the automorphisms (the group of invertible natural isomorphisms from F to itself, where F is the forgetful functor that sends a GSet to its underlying set) Aut(F) = Set^(SetG)(F,F) = Set^(SetG)(SetG(G, -), SetG(G, -)) = SetG(G, G) = G. Abusing notation for GSet and isomorphisms are the consequences of the Yoneda lemma's lemma. *//* Schur's lemma; applied on abelian groups we have G abelian, V irreducible, V = W and the nonzero linear map is a scalar multiple of an eigenvalue, therefore the result is that every subspace ofV is invariant, V is one dimensional, take homomorphism to the dual group of the multiplicative complex numbers aka the circle group aka you can use complex exponentials to represent any abelian group:  Maps from V to V is G linear for every p if and only if g is in the centre of G, but the centre of G is G for an abelian group */
