/* Etale topology, gives a uniform definition of Galois groups and fundamental groups:   this definition is given by Galois connections, Galois groups classifies finite field extensions, fundamental group classifies finite covering spaces, etale morphisms behaves like local homeomorphisms, define etale sheaves and etale covering spaces. The etale fundamental group is defined as the automorphism group of the fibre functor from the category of finite etale covers of X to finite sets. This definition using automorphism groups classify finite etale covers of X. If you pick X as the prime spectrum of a field, you recover the finite separable extension when you apply the definition of a finite etale cover, the etale fundamental group must therefore be the absolute Galois group. Exercise, what about X = complex algebraic varieties (hint: profinite completion of the topological fundamental group). This defines the etale fundamental group of a scheme. */

/* Frobenius map, automorphism on finite fields of prime power order p^n:   This is an automorphism because automorphism it sends the field to itself, since raising to the p-th power permutes all elements. Repeating the Frobenius map n-times gives identity so it is of order n. The Galois group Gal(F_p/F_p^n) is generated by the single Frobenius automorphism and can be computed as the group Z/nZ. */

/* Ramification, prime ideals, imagine the prime ideals of Z as points on a number line. When we extend to a larger number field, this line is "unfolded" into a higher-dimensional space. The prime ideals in the larger field are also points, but some of them might "pile up" on top of the original prime ideal. In the case of Q(root 5)/Q, the prime (5) splits into (5) twice, which can be visualized as two points "collapsing" onto the original point. This is the geometric intuition of ramification:  In algebraic number theory, ramification describes the behavior of a prime ideal p in a number field K when it is extended to a larger number field L. The ideal pO_L​ factors into a product of prime ideals in the ring of integers of L. Ramification occurs when at least one of these prime factors appears with a power greater than 1. This "bunching up" or "confluence" of prime factors is a fundamental concept. For example, in the extension Q(root 5)/Q, the prime ideal (5) of Z"ramifies" as it becomes the ideal (root 5​)^2 in the ring of integers Z[1 + root(5) / 2] */
/* Ramification, domain P^1 as a sphere. The map z to z^2 wraps the sphere around itself twice. The points z=0 and z= infity are ramification points. This is where the wrapping "bunches up," and the pre-image of the image point is not a single point but a single point with multiplicity:  For a non-constant morphism of smooth curves f: X to Y, a point p in X is a ramification point if the corresponding map on local rings is not an isomorphism. This is a geometric phenomenon where the map "folds" or "pinches" the curve at a point. The degree of ramification is measured by the ramification index, which is a key invariant. For example, the map f: P^1 to P^1 given by z to z2 is ramified at the point z = 0. */
/* Ramification, real place is a point on a line. A complex place is a pair of points. The ramification of a real place into a complex one can be visualized as a single point on a line "splitting" into two points in a higher-dimensional space:  In the theory of valuations, ramification describes the behavior of a place of a number field in an extension. A place can be a prime ideal (finite place) or an embedding into the real or complex numbers (infinite place). Ramification of a finite place means the valuation of an element changes in a non-trivial way, while for infinite places it means a real place becomes a complex one. For example, in Q(root(-1))/Q, the real place of Q is ramified because it becomes a complex place. */
/* Ramification, Galois group as a group of symmetries of the extension. The decomposition group of a prime ideal is a subgroup that fixes the ideal. Ramification means that this subgroup is not trivial, so there are some "symmetries" that leave the ideal unchanged:  In a Galois extension of number fields L/K, ramification occurs when the decomposition group of a prime ideal is not trivial. This means that there are elements in the Galois group that fix the prime ideal but not the elements in its ring. This is a subtle but deep concept that links the algebraic properties of the extension to its number-theoretic properties. */
/* Ramification, imagine a sheet of paper. A branched cover is like folding the paper and then projecting it onto a line. The folds are the ramification locus, and the line they are projected onto is the branch locus. The map from the curve to the line is a branched cover that folds the curve at the points where the tangent is vertical: A branched cover is a surjective map of varieties with ramification. The set of ramification points is called the ramification locus, and its image is the branch locus. The map from a variety to its base is a local isomorphism everywhere except at the ramification locus. For example, the map from the curve y^2 = x(x−1)(x−2) to the affine line given by projection to the x-axis is a branched cover. */
/* Ramification, imagine a map from a disk to a disk. A critical point is a point where the map "flattens" or "folds" the disk. The dynamics around this point are very complex and can lead to chaotic behavior:  In dynamics, ramification occurs in complex dynamics when a map has critical points. A critical point is a point where the derivative of the map is zero. This is a point where the map "folds" or "pinches." For example, the map z to z^2 has a critical point at z=0. */
/* Ramification, canonical divisor is a geometric object that is a "dual" to the tangent bundle. It is a line bundle that is related to the ramification of the map:  The canonical divisor of a curve is a divisor that is related to the ramification of the curve. The degree of the canonical divisor is related to the genus of the curve and the ramification of the map. */
/* Ramification, Hilbert symbol is a "map" that measures the ramification. It is a way of "quantifying" the ramification:  The Hilbert symbol is a symbol that measures the ramification of a number field extension. The Hilbert symbol is a key tool in class field theory. */
/* Ramification, Serre duality is a "duality" between two geometric objects. The ramification of the map is a key ingredient in this duality:  The concept of ramification is used to formulate Serre duality, which is a duality theorem for coherent sheaves on a scheme. The duality is between the cohomology of a sheaf and the cohomology of its dual. */
/* Ramification, covering space is a "bundle" of spaces. A ramified covering space is a covering space that "folds" or "pinches" at some points: A ramified covering space is a generalization of a covering space. A covering space has the property that the fibers are discrete sets. A ramified covering space has the property that the fibers can have "ramification." */
/* Ramification, moduli space of curves is a geometric object. The ramification of a family of curves is a phenomenon that occurs when the fibers of the family have "non-trivial" automorphisms:  The concept of ramification is used to study the moduli space of curves. The moduli space is a geometric object that classifies curves. The ramification of a family of curves is a phenomenon that occurs when the fibers of the family have "non-trivial" automorphisms. */

This can be visualized as the rotations and reflections of an equilateral triangle whose vertices are the three roots in the complex plane. The rotation by 120 degrees corresponds to the automorphism σ that sends cube root of 2 to omega cube root of 2: Galois group is the group of all automorphisms of a field extension L/K that fix the base field K. It is a finite group that encodes the symmetries of the roots of a polynomial.

The deck transformation group is the group of translations by integers, Z. This can be visualized as the integer lattice on the real line, with the group Z acting by shifting the entire line by an integer. The Galois group is this group of shifts:  In topology, the Galois group of a regular covering space E to B is the group of deck transformations of the covering. The fundamental group of the base space, π^1​(B), acts on the fibers, and the group of deck transformations is the group of symmetries of this action. */

The group of symmetries that preserve the origin of the curve is the Galois group:  For a non-singular projective curve X over an algebraically closed field, its Galois group is a finite group of automorphisms of X. For example, the group of automorphisms of an elliptic curve is a finite group. */
/* Galois group, number field K, the "space" Spec(K) is not a usual geometric space but a set of points (the prime ideals). A finite étale covering corresponds to a finite field extension.

The Galois group is the group of automorphisms that preserve the structure of this graph:  The Galois group of a field K can be generalized as the étale fundamental group of Spec(K), denoted π1et​(Spec(K)). This is a profinite group that classifies all finite étale coverings of Spec(K). */
/* Galois group, a field K, consider the tree of all finite extensions of K. The root is K. The branches from a field L are the extensions of L. The Galois group of the maximal abelian extension of K acts on this tree. This can be visualized as a dendrogram or a family tree, where the Galois group is a group of symmetries that rearranges the branches while preserving the relationships between the fields: A Galois group can act as a group of automorphisms of a rooted tree.

/* Galois group, the extension Q(i)/Q with Galois group {1,σ}. The prime p=5 splits into ideals (2+i) and (2−i). The Frobenius element for (2+i) is the identity, and for (2−i) it's the identity as well (they are in the same orbit). For p=3, the prime is inert, and the Frobenius element is σ. This can be visualized as a collection of points (the prime ideals), with the Frobenius element acting as a transformation on them. The Galois group is the group of all these transformations:  For an abelian extension of a number field L/K, the Galois group is the group generated by the Frobenius automorphisms. The Frobenius element at a prime p of K is the unique automorphism that acts as the p-th power map on the residue field. */

We can visualize the cohomology group H1(G,L×) as the set of "loops" in a complex of G-modules that cannot be "filled in" or "shrunk to a point." The fact that H1(G,L×) is trivial is a statement that these loops are "fillable.":  In homological algebra, the Galois group G=Gal(L/K) acts on the multiplicative group of the field L×. The cohomology group H1(G,L×) measures the "failure" of Hilbert's Theorem 90, which states that any element with norm 1 is of the form σ(x)/x. This is a fundamental result in Galois cohomology. */
