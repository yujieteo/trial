/* Static analyses of programs, Rice's theorem:  idea is you want to statically analyse whether a program will execute without errors, define semantic property about program's behaviour example given is halting problems unlike syntactic property, generalises halting problem, cannot check any given program is correct. Corollary (in engineering): reduce complexity of machines from Turing completeness or design programs that make it statically correct or be like me, do not program if you do not need to. */
/* Kleene's recursion theorem, proving Rice's theorem in ZFC:  uses contradiction, assume nontrivial extension computable set of natural numbers P, so there is natural number a in P and natural number b not in P. Define a function Q by Q_e(x) = phi_b(x) where e is in P, and Q_e(x) = phi_a(x) where e is not in P. Subscript differs based on membership in P. By Kleene's recurison theorem phi_e is definable isomorphic (in the Roger's fixed point theorem sense) Q_e or this function is a Roger's fixed point function since we assumed this is a nontrivial extension computable set of natural numbers, this contradicts extensionality since phi_a = phi_b = phi_e since e in P and e not in P. */
/* Roger's fixed point theorem, explains intuition in Rice's theorem, and the halting problem:  since we can have a Roger's fixed point theorem, we can't have a program that changes the extensional behaviour of all programs i.e. there is a program unaffected by the change, therefore there is a program that is unaffected by checking the termination on given natural number, a program that is unaffected by checking for equivalence of programs. So on and so forth, this is the intuitive reason why Rice's theorem works, it all stems from the nonexistence of a program that determines the extensional behaviour of all programs OR you can always design a program that is invariant by the extension program. */
/* Roger's fixed point theorem, extensions of programs:  if F is a total computable function, it has a fixed point such that phi_e is isomorphic to phi_F(e), where phi is an admissible numbering of the partial recursive function, phi_e is this function corresponding to index e, F is (I made this up) definably isomorphic to G as partial function on the naturals if F(n) and G(n) are both defined and equal, otherwise they are both undefined. This guarantees the existence of a program that is not altered by any transformation from programming instructions. Given any effective procedure to transform programs, there is always a program that, when modified by the procedure, does exactly what it did before. Or, corollary, there is no program that changes the extensional behaviour of all programs. Space of Turing complete programs is too big, so there alawys is a Roger's fixed point. */
