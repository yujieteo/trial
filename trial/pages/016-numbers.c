/* Number theory, unique factorization of polynomials:  one can transplant ideas gleaned from the study of number theory into the study of polynomials (although these are not really distinct). Product formulas, classification using cyclic groups, and other fairly similar intuitions can be similarly transplanted into polynomials. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem with certain extra thinking about how to make the polynomial smooth or continuous enough gives a nice correspondence between polynomials and functions, with the right weakening of this correspondence applying to generalized functions. This is why I find number theory motivating for me, an engineer by training. */
/* Finite field extension, correct generalization of prime factorization:  one cares about how to generalize the integers having a unique prime factorization, let K be a finite field extension of the rationals, then let O_K denote the ring of algebraic integers in K, the ideals in O_K factor uniquely into prime ideals as a lemma. */
/* Ideals, Yoneda embedding for posets:   Dedekind constructed the reals from the rationals, one embeds the rationals in its power set by defining the representative set (known as a Dedekind cut) using the least upper bound of the rationals as the Yoneda embedding on the poset of the rationals. This is an order preserving injection, you can work with these sets instead of the original rational numbers. The similar idea is to consider ideal sets where you have powers of rationals bounded by an integer, then embed the divisibility relation. For example, define the analogous Dedekind cut S_x by elements a in the integers adjoined the square root of negative 5 such that x divides a. Now take the kernel under homomorphisms from this field extension into an integral domain. One obtains ideals this way. See Qiaochu Yuan's blog post on primes and ideals. */
/* Irreducible element, fix Euclid's algorithm:  see example of the integers adjoined root(-5), the Euclid's algorithm fails, these are the elements that cannot be factored further. But the right notion of primarily is the one where prime p divides ab means a prime p divides a or prime p divides b, this is the right notion of primality (in fact Euclid's lemma becomes a definition here) because it allows us to cancel factors in two different prime factorization of an integer. Note that this is strangely category theoretical or algebraic flavored. */
/* Euclid's algorithm, proof that the integers Z are a principal ideal domain:  here is a proof sketch, the key step aq + r = b, but the remainder r must be zero since sums of ideals are in ideals. Consider I as ideal of Z, if I is zero ideal then this is principal. Suppose, without loss of generality, I as a nonzero ideal, let l be smallest positive element in I, it exists by the by well ordering of integers, (l) = I, (l) is in I, since for product integer lr in I, the remainder r is an integer, let b in the ideal I, use Euclid's algorithm, therefore so b = aq + r, so the remainder must be zero, b = aq, so the ideal (a) generates I for any ideal in the ring of integers Z. Surprisingly, this means that zero remainder gives equivalence of linear combinations and products to give principal ideals. One must consider the ideas used in the proof that the product of principal ideals is an ideal to reconcile this fact. */
/* Greatest common divisor, preserve information on scalars as a meet:  consider gcd(ab, ac) = a gcd(b, c) holds because we are taking the greatest of something. Change the notation, a(b ^ c) = (ab) ^ (ac), multiplication by integer a can be thought of as a functor on the poset, this is Yoneda flavoured, f_a(x) = ax, this is a monotone map because x | y implies ax | ay, we have f_a(b ^ c) = f_a(b) ^ f_a(c) or that multiplication by a preserves meets. Left adjoints on posets preserve joins (colimits), right adjoints on posets preserves meets (limits), so multiplication by a is a right adjoint functor. The left adjoint to multiplication by a, f_a, is simply division by gcd(a,y), or g_a(y) = y / gcd(a,y), this forms a Galois connection. Similarly, intersections (meets) preserving scalar multiplication is another example (scalar multiplication is right adjoint over poset of ideals). The opposite property corresponds to left adjoints like the extension of scalars or localisation. */
