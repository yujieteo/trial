/* Finite dimensional vector spaces, norm construction is induced by the topology:  we show that every vector space has a norm. Every vector space has a finite linear combination of basis vectors (even if it has infinite dimensions, this uses some weird completion magic). Take the maximum of the coefficients amongst finitely many basis vectors, this defines one possible norm that is induced by the topology, particularly by the dimension of the vector space. Infinite dimensional TOPOLOGICAL vector spaces do not have a norm that induces the topology. */
