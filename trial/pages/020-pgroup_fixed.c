/* p-group fixed point theorem, definition:  Let G be a finite p-group acting on a finite set X, Let X^G denote the subset of X consisting of elements fixed by G then |X^G| is congruent to |X| mod p, in particular if p does not divide |X|, then G has a fixed point. */
/* p-group fixed point theorem, combinatorial counting argument:  Partition a set to orbits, then use the fact that size of any non-fixed orbit must be a multiple of p, to get a congruence relation. */
/* p-group fixed point theorem, links divisibility to the order of the group:  links divisibility of the group's order to the divisibility of orbit sizes, prove existence results by showing a certain count is divisible by p. */
/* p-group fixed point theorem, formalises group action inertia:  Grop action may have some fixed points. */
/* p-group fixed point theorem, special case of orbit stabiliser theorem:  Leverages specific properties of p-groups to simplify the more complex orbit sum formula */
/* p-group fixed point theorem, existence proofs:  Define a clever group action, use the theorem to prove the existence of properties like nontrivial centers */
/* p-group fixed point theorem, nilpotency marker:  nilpotency shows how close a group is to being abelian */
/* p-group fixed point theorem, partitioning strategy:  Highlights how you can partition a set to disjoint orbits */
/* p-group fixed point theorem, nontrivial center or X^p is nilpotent:  Consider group X^p \ {0}, cardinality p^n - 1, for X, not divisible by p, nontrivial center of fixed point exists. */
