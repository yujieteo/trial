/* Derived category, conceptual compression:  Compresses it the notion of a category down to a homological core. */
/* Derived category, quasi-isomorphisms:  Quasi-isomorphisms are treated as if they are isomorphisms */
/* Derived category, homotopy category:  category, objects are chain complexes, morphisms are chain homotopies of chain maps */
/* Derived category, localization of category of complexes:  Localisation of category of complexes with respect to the class of all quasi-isomorphisms, formalises inverting a set of maps */
/* Derived category, formal inverses:  To build it, add a formal inverse for every quasi-isomorphism */
/* Derived category, fuzzy equality:  Two complexes are equal if they are related by a chain of quasi-isomorphisms, a kind of fuzzy equality */
/* Derived category, reducing dimension:  Takes a complex, sequence of object, and squash it down, retaining only the homology groups */
/* Derived category, cohomology as invariant:  Since quasi-isomorphisms are inverted in defining an invariant category, therefore cohomology does not change. */
/* Derived category, triangulated category:  Shift functors and distinguished triangles can be used to define a derived category */
/* Derived category, generalises non-abelian categories:  Do homological algebra without commutative and additive structure of abelian category */
/* Derived category, algebraic topology:  Algebra of homotopy category of topological space */
/* Derived category, new invariants:  Define derived functors that are more robust */
/* Derived category, universal property:  Unique category that inverts quasi-isomorphisms most efficiently */
/* Derived category, formalises equivalence of non-strictly isomorphic objects:  Equivalence of two non-strictly isomorphic objects */
