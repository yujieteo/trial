/* Vector bundle, vector space fibres: a vector bundle is a specific type of fiber bundle where the fibres are vector spaces (my intuition for bundles are similar to that of basis, for vectors you glue [take colimits] vectors together, for topological spaces you glue open neighbourhoods, for schemes you glue local rings [literally look like rings for me], for infinity categories or stacky stuff you glue group(oids)). It consists of a total space E, a base space X, and a projection map p: E to X */
/* Vector bundle, locally trivial, visual intuition is open subset is Cartesian producted with a copy of the R^n (example for visual imagination is R^1):  for every point x in the base space X, there is a neighborhood U and an isomorphism fibres over U to be isomorphic the cartesian product of U and R^n, which is a local trivialization. */
/* Vector bundle, transition functions:  local trivializations on overlapping neighborhoods are related by transition functions, which are continuous maps from the overlap to the general linear group GLn(R) */
/* Vector bundle, continuous sections:  continuous section of a vector bundle is a continuous map s: X to E such that p * s is the identity map on X. The set of all continuous sections forms a module over the ring of continuous functions on X. */
/* Vector bundle, rank:  rank of a vector bundle is the dimension n of the vector space fibers. A rank 1 bundle is a line bundle. Recall that rank is output of linear map is dimensional 1. */
/* Vector bundle, trivial:  trivial if it is globally isomorphic to a product space X × R^n. This is the simplest type of vector bundle, and its continuous sections correspond to a free module. */
/* Vector bundle, subbundle:  sub-space of a vector bundle that is itself a vector bundle. Its continuous sections form a submodule. */
/* Vector bundle, pullback bundle:  pullback of a vector bundle along a map f: Y → X is a new vector bundle over the space Y, which gives a way to "transport" the bundle's structure. */
/* Vector bundle, Whitney sum:  two vector bundles E1​ and E2​ over the same base space X is a new vector bundle E1​ ⊕ E2​ whose fibers are the direct sums of the fibers of the original bundles. */
/* Vector bundle, classification:  Vector bundles of rank n on a space X are classified by homotopy classes of maps from X to the Grassmannian manifold G_n​(R^∞). */
/* Vector bundle, locally free sheaf:  algebraic analog of a vector bundle is a locally free sheaf. A sheaf of modules is locally free if every point in the scheme has a neighborhood where the sheaf is isomorphic to a free sheaf of finite rank. */
/* Vector bundle, Serre-Swan:  compact topological space X, the category of continuous vector bundles on X is equivalent to the category of finitely generated projective modules over the ring of continuous functions C(X). */
/* Vector bundle, projective module:  Swan's theorem provides an algebraic definition of a vector bundle: it's a finitely generated projective module. This allows us to use the tools of commutative algebra to study geometric objects. */
/* Vector bundle, flat modules:  vector bundle corresponds to a finitely presented flat module. This is a weaker condition than projective, and it is the correct algebraic counterpart for schemes that are not regular. */
/* Vector bundle, on schemes:  vector bundle over a scheme is defined as a locally free sheaf of modules of constant finite rank. This directly translates the topological definition into the language of algebraic geometry. */
/* Vector bundle, perfect complex:  chain complex of modules that is locally quasi-isomorphic to a finite complex of free modules. This object captures the "homotopical" nature of vector bundles. */
/* Vector bundle, line bundle:  vector bundle of rank 1 is a line bundle. In algebraic geometry, these correspond to invertible sheaves, which are key to studying divisors and rational maps. */
/* Vector bundle, torsor:  vector bundle is a torsor under a group scheme. For a line bundle, this is an algebraic version of a principal bundle. */
/* Vector bundle, algebraic:  algebraic vector bundle on a scheme is a coherent sheaf that is locally free. */
/* Vector bundle, Grothendieck group:  set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles over a topological space X forms an abelian group called the topological K-theory group K_0​(X) under the Whitney sum operation. The algebraic counterpart is the Grothendieck group K_0​(R) of a ring, which is generated by finitely generated projective modules. */
/* Vector bundle, torsors in algebraic geometry, vector bundle as a scheme, vectors floating above circle and seen as torsors, vectors can be reached by other linear transformations:  vector bundle is a scheme E over a base scheme X together with a map π: E → X such that for any point x ∈ X, the fiber π−1(x) is a vector space, and locally, E is isomorphic to a product of X and a vector space. A torsor is a principal homogeneous space for a group scheme G. A vector bundle can be viewed as a torsor for the general linear group scheme, GLn​.  Imagine a base space (e.g., a circle) and over each point of the circle, a vector space "floating" above it. This forms a vector bundle. This bundle can be seen as a torsor for the group of linear transformations of the fiber. This means that if we are at a point on the base circle and we pick a vector in the fiber, any other vector in the same fiber can be reached by a unique linear transformation from the general linear group. */
/* Vector bundles, via transition functions, curved surface is base schemes, each vector bundle is a single product space or a trivial bundle, transition functions give gluing: A vector bundle can be defined by an open cover of the base space and a set of transition functions (automorphisms of the fiber) on the overlaps. These functions satisfy the cocycle condition. Imagine a curved surface (the base scheme) covered by flat patches. Over each patch, the vector bundle is a simple product space (a trivial bundle). The transition functions are the "instructions" for how to glue the patches together. This gluing process is a group action, specifically by GLn​. */
/* Fibration, cylinder E=S1× cross mapped to a circle B=S1 by the projection p(x,t)=x. The fibers are the vertical line segments {x} cross I above each point x on the circle. If you have a path on the circle (the base) and a starting point on the cylinder above it, you can "lift" the path smoothly up to the cylinder. This ability to lift any path from the base to a unique path in the total space makes it a fibration:  fibration is a continuous map p:E to B between topological spaces, satisfying the homotopy lifting property. This means that for any space X, any map f:X to E, and any homotopy H: X cross I to B of the base map p * f, there is a unique homotopy lift H~: X cross I→E such that p * H~ is equal to H and H~(x,0)=f(x). Intuitively, a fibration is a map that "projects" a more complex space E onto a simpler space B in a way that allows us to lift paths from the base to the total space. */
/* Fibration, a family of elliptic curves over the projective line P1. Each point of the base space P1 corresponds to an elliptic curve, which is the fiber. A map from a curve C to our family of elliptic curves on the base can be "lifted" to a map from C to the total space. This means that if we continuously move a point on the base, the corresponding elliptic curve (the fiber) will also vary smoothly: a projective morphism of schemes f: X to Y is a fibration in a geometric sense. It is a scheme-theoretic analogue of a fibration in topology, where the fibers are projective varieties. This implies that for a suitable base space, the fibers over its points are all "the same," and we can "move" a fiber over one point to a fiber over another point. */
/* Fibration, the map from the 2-sphere S2 to the projective plane RP^2 that identifies antipodal points. The fiber over a point in RP^2 consists of two points. This map is not a fibration in the strict sense, but it is a quasi-fibration. We can't lift every path uniquely, but it still induces a long exact sequence of homotopy groups, which tells us about the structure of the spaces: a quasi-fibration is a continuous map p : E to B with the property that the induced map on homotopy groups P_n​(p): P_n​(E, F_b​) to P_n​(B,b) is an isomorphism for all n more than or equal to 0, where F_b​ is the fibre over the base point b. This is a weaker condition than the homotopy lifting property but is often sufficient for constructing long exact sequences of homotopy groups. */
/* Fibration, the ring R as a space of "algebraic objects." We want to "zoom in" on a specific prime ideal P. The localization R_P​ is a "local neighborhood" around P. The map from R to R_P​ is like a projection. The "fibers" are the sets of all elements in R that are not in P. This process "lifts" a global property (the ring R) to a local one (R+P​) in a way that preserves all information about the ideal P:  the process of localization of a non-commutative ring R at a prime ideal P can be viewed as a fibration. The map from the ring R to the localized ring R_P​ is an algebraic fibration. The "fibers" are the rings of endomorphisms of modules, and the fibration is a way to understand the module as a "sheaf" over the spectrum of the ring. */
/* Fibration, the module M as a central object. We build a tower of projective modules P0​,P1​,P2​,... that "cover" it. The map from the tower to the module is a projection. The "fibers" are the submodules that are "killed" at each step. This process allows us to lift properties from the module to its resolution, and the properties of the fibration ensure that this is a well-behaved process. For example, to find the Ext groups, we use a projective resolution, which is a fibration in this sense: A resolution of a module M by projective modules, ... to P1​ to P0​ to M to 0, can be seen as a fibration. The map from the chain complex of projective modules to the module M is a fibration in the context of chain complexes. The "fibers" are the kernels of the maps in the complex. */
/* Fibration, a flow on a torus T^2 = S^1 × S^1. We can project this flow onto one of the circles, say S1. The fiber over each point of the base circle is the other circle. The map is a fibration. A path on the torus can be projected onto a path on the base circle, and the fibration property means we can lift a path from the base to a path on the torus. This allows us to understand the complex dynamics on the torus by studying the simpler dynamics on the base circle and the fiber:  for a dynamical system, a fiber bundle is a manifold E with a projection map p: E to B such that for every point x in the base space B, there is a neighborhood U of x and a homeomorphism from p−1(U) to U × F, where F is the fiber. This describes how a dynamical system (like a flow on a manifold) can be decomposed into a base flow and a flow on the fiber. */
/* Fibration, a map from the spectrum of the ring of integers of a number field K, Spec(O_K​), to the spectrum of the integers, Spec(Z). The fibers over prime ideals in Z are the prime ideals in OK​ that lie above them. This is an étale fibration. The fibration property means that locally, the map looks like a product. For example, the map from Spec(Z[i]) to Spec(Z) is an étale fibration over primes p congruent 1(mod4). The fiber over such a prime p consists of two points, corresponding to the two prime ideals above it: a étale morphism of schemes f: X to Y is a flat, unramified morphism of finite type. It is a fibration in the context of schemes, where the fibers are finite sets. The map is a local isomorphism for the étale topology. */
/* Fibration, a sphere S2. The set of all tangent vectors of length 1 is a manifold called the tangent bundle T1S2. There is a map from T1S2 to S2 that sends a vector to the point where it is attached. The fiber over each point is a circle S1. This is a principal S1-bundle. The fibration property says that we can "lift" a path on the sphere to a path of unit tangent vectors. The group action allows us to "rotate" the fibers: A principal G-bundle is a fibration p:E to B with a right action of a topological group G on the total space E such that the map E × G to E×B given by (e,g) mapped to (eg,p(e)) is a homeomorphism, and the fibers are homeomorphic to the group G. */
/* Fibration, is like a projection, where we "collapse" a space down to a simpler one. A cofibration is like an inclusion, where we "build" a larger space by including a smaller one. For example, the map from the cylinder to the circle is a fibration. The map from the boundary of a disk to the disk itself is a cofibration. They are "opposite" but related concepts:  Eckmann-Hilton duality is a concept that relates products and coproducts, and it can be applied to fibrations and cofibrations. A fibration is a map that has the homotopy lifting property, while a cofibration is a map that has the homotopy extension property. These two concepts are dual. */
/* Fibration, imagine  the number field Q as a line. The "base" is the set of all prime numbers and the point at infinity. The fiber over each prime p is the field of p-adic numbers Qp​, and the fiber over infinity is the real numbers R. The fibration property means we can "lift" a path from the base to the arithmetic curve. This allows us to study the number field by looking at its local behavior:  In Arakelov geometry, a number field is treated as a 1-dimensional arithmetic curve. This curve can be thought of as a fibration over a "base" that is the set of all places of the field. The fibers are the completions of the field at each place. */
/* Fibration, imagine a functor F that maps modules to other modules. We can think of this as a projection. A derived functor Extn is a way to "lift" this projection to a higher dimension. The fibration property means that we can lift a chain map to a homotopy class of chain maps. This provides a way to compute the "failure" of an exact sequence to remain exact after applying a functor: A derived functor, like Ext or Tor, is a fibration of functors. The derived category is a categorical way to deal with resolutions, which are fibrations. The maps between objects in the derived category are "homotopy classes of chain maps." */
/* Fibration, consider a family of conics in the plane. We can parameterize this family by a base space, say the real line. The fiber over each point is a conic. For example, the fiber over a point t could be the conic x^2 + y^2 = t. As we move the parameter t, the conic changes. The fibration property means that this change is smooth and well-behaved: A flat morphism f: X to Y is a family of varieties. The fibers over the points of the base Y are the varieties of the family. A flat morphism is a fibration in the sense that the fibers are all "the same" in some sense, and they vary smoothly with the base. */
/* Fibration, a quiver as a directed graph. A representation is a set of vector spaces attached to the vertices and linear maps attached to the arrows. A map from one representation to another is a collection of maps between the corresponding vector spaces. The fibration property means that we can "lift" a map on the quiver to a map on the vector spaces: A quiver representation is a collection of vector spaces and linear maps between them. A map between two quiver representations can be seen as a fibration. The fibers are the vector spaces that are "killed" by the map. */
/* Fibration, a map from a number field to a smaller number field. The map on the spectra is a fibration. The fibers are the prime ideals that lie above a given prime. This map induces a fibration of fundamental groups. The fibration property means we can lift a "path of prime ideals" in the base to a "path of prime ideals" in the total space:  The fundamental group of a scheme is a pro-finite group. A map of schemes can induce a fibration of fundamental groups. The fibration property means we can lift a path from the base group to the total group. */
/* Cofibration, imagine a hollow sphere A=S2 and a solid ball X=D3. The inclusion map i: S2 to D3 is a cofibration. If we have a map from the ball to another space, and we start to deform the sphere (the boundary of the ball), we can always deform the whole ball in a consistent way. The boundary is "stuck" to the ball in a way that allows us to push any deformation from the boundary into the interior. This is the dual concept to a fibration, which allows us to "lift" homotopies from a base space: A cofibration is a continuous map i: Ato X between topological spaces that satisfies the homotopy extension property. This means that for any space Y, any map f: X to Y, and any homotopy H:A cross I to Y of the restricted map f∣A​, there exists a homotopy lift H~:X cross I to Y that extends H. In other words, any homotopy defined on the subspace A can be "extended" to a homotopy on the entire space X. */
/* Cofibration, a space A and two maps, f: A to B and g: A to C. The pushout of this diagram is a space P that "glues" B and C together along the image of A. If the map A to B is a cofibration, the pushout is well-behaved. For example, if we glue two disks together along a circle, the resulting space is a sphere. The inclusion of the circle into the disk is a cofibration, and this property ensures that the gluing is well-behaved:  The homotopy extension property can be formulated in terms of a pushout square. A cofibration is a map A to X such that a specific pushout square is a pullback square. */
/* Cofibration, the inclusion of the origin in the affine plane. This is a closed immersion. The map from Spec(k[x,y]/(x,y)) to Spec(k[x,y]) is a closed immersion. This is a geometric "cofibration," where a smaller space is "stuck" inside a larger one in a very rigid way. The embedding is a cofibration because any map from the origin to a scheme can be extended to the entire plane: A closed immersion of schemes f:X→Y is a morphism that is a homeomorphism onto its image, and the induced map on sheaves of rings is a surjective map. A closed immersion is a "cofibration" in the geometric sense, as it embeds one scheme as a closed subscheme of another. */
/* Cofibration, a free module F and a submodule N. The inclusion of N into F is a cofibration. A free module is a "cofibrant" object, and this is a key property in homological algebra. It means that the module can be "built" from a free module:  In the category of modules over a non-commutative ring, a cofibration is a module homomorphism that is an injective map with a projective cokernel. This is a "dual" concept to a fibration, which is a surjective map with an injective kernel. */
/* Cofibration, consider field F_p​ as a single point. The field F_{p^n}​ is a larger field with more points. The inclusion map is a cofibration. This is a way of "embedding" a smaller algebraic object into a larger one. This is a fundamental construction in arithmetic geometry:  In the context of number theory, a cofibration can be seen through the lens of a Frobenius map. The inclusion of a finite field into a larger finite field can be seen as a cofibration. */
/* Cofibration, the group algebra F_p ​_Cp​. The simple module F_p​ is not projective. However, we can find a projective module P and a map from P to F_p​. The kernel of this map is a submodule. The inclusion of the kernel into the projective module is a "cofibration." This is a way of "building" a simple module from a projective one:  In the category of modules over a group algebra, a cofibration is a module homomorphism that is an injective map with a projective cokernel. This is a key property for understanding the structure of modules and their relationships. */
/* Cofibration, building a 2-sphere by starting with a point, attaching two lines (a "figure eight"), and then attaching a disk. At each step, the inclusion of the subcomplex is a cofibration. This is a way of "building" a complex space from simpler pieces in a well-behaved way. The cofibration property guarantees that the attachment is "non-trivial.": A CW complex is a space built up by attaching cells of increasing dimension. The inclusion of a subcomplex into a CW complex is a cofibration. This is a powerful property that makes CW complexes well-behaved in homotopy theory. */
/* Cofibration, formal scheme is a "germ" of a scheme along a closed subscheme. The inclusion of the formal scheme of the origin in the formal scheme of the affine line is a cofibration. This is a way of "embedding" a local object into a larger one: A closed immersion of formal schemes is a cofibration in the category of formal schemes. This is a way of embedding a formal scheme as a closed subscheme of another. */
/* Cofibration, a ring of integers Z is a principal ideal domain, so every ideal is free, and thus projective. The inclusion of an ideal, say 2Z, into Z is a cofibration. This is a way of "embedding" a module into a larger one in a well-behaved way: A ring R is left hereditary if every left ideal is a projective module. This means that every inclusion of a left ideal into the ring is a cofibration. This is a very strong property that is a key to understanding the homological properties of the ring. */
/* Cofibration, inclusion of a compact manifold into a larger one is a proper morphism. For example, the inclusion of a sphere into R3 is a proper morphism. This is a way of "embedding" a compact object into a larger one: A proper morphism of schemes is a morphism that is separated, of finite type, and universally closed. A proper morphism is a "cofibration" in a strong sense. It is a map that is a closed embedding. */
/* Cofibration, the ring of integers Z. The inclusion of Z into the ring of rational numbers Q is a cofibration. This is a way of "embedding" a ring into a field:  The inclusion of a ring into its localization at a prime ideal is a cofibration in a sense. The localization process is a way of "embedding" a ring into a larger one. */
