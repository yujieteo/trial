/* Spectrum, a linear transformation T in R^2 represented by a matrix. The eigenvectors are the directions (vectors) that get stretched or shrunk but not rotated. The spectrum is the set of these stretching factors of the eigenvalues. For a more general operator on an infinite-dimensional space, an element in the spectrum isn't necessarily an eigenvalue. It's a "near eigenvalue." It's a value lambda where (A−lambda I) isn't invertible. Imagine the operator A as a machine that transforms vectors. If you feed in a vector v and get a result close to lambda v for some λ, then λ is in the spectrum. The visual intuition is that the spectrum is the set of all possible "scaling factors" of the operator. For example, for the differentiation operator D=d/dx on the space of polynomials, its spectrum is the entire complex plane, because for any lambda, the equation D f− lambda f=g can be difficult to solve:  The spectrum of a bounded linear operator A on a Banach space X is the set of all lambda in C for which the operator (A − lambda I)does not have a bounded inverse. This is a generalization of the concept of eigenvalues for finite-dimensional matrices. */
/* Spectrum, electron in an atom. Its energy is an observable. The possible energy levels are discrete and quantized, forming a discrete spectrum. This is like a ladder of allowed energy levels. If you measure the electron's energy, the result must be one of the values on the ladder. For a free particle, its momentum can take on any real value, so its spectrum is continuous, like a ramp. The spectrum is a visual representation of the allowed states or outcomes of a physical system. For the position operator X on L^2(R), the spectrum is the real line R:  The spectrum of a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space represents the set of all possible outcomes of a physical measurement. An observable, like position or momentum, is represented by such an operator, and its spectrum gives the possible values that can be measured. */
/* Spectrum, a musical chord. It's a combination of different pure tones, each with a specific frequency and amplitude. The spectrum of the sound wave is a plot showing which frequencies are present and how strong they are. For a pure sine wave, the spectrum is a single point at its frequency. For a more complex function, the spectrum is a collection of points or a continuous curve. The Fourier transform takes a function in the time domain and gives us its spectrum in the frequency domain. For example, the function f(t)=cos(2 pi t)+cos(4 pi t) has a spectrum with two peaks, one at frequency 1 Hz and another at frequency 2 Hz:  The spectrum of a function is the set of frequencies present in its Fourier transform. It tells us which sinusoidal components make up the function. */
/* Spectrum a network of interconnected nodes, like social media users or a transportation system. The eigenvalues of the graph's adjacency matrix reveal how well-connected the graph is. A graph with a larger number of distinct eigenvalues is often more complex. For example, the spectrum of a complete graph _​ is (n−1,−1,...,−1), while the spectrum of a path graph is quite different. The spectrum can be seen as a fingerprint of the graph's structure:  the spectrum of a graph is the multiset of eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix, or a related matrix like the graph Laplacian. These eigenvalues provide information about the graph's structure, like its connectivity and diameter. */
/* Spectrum, vibrating drumhead. Its vibration pattern is a solution to the wave equation. The possible modes of vibration are the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator on the drumhead. Each mode vibrates at a specific frequency, which is an eigenvalue. By representing any vibration as a sum of these modes, we can solve the wave equation. The spectrum of the Laplacian gives us the fundamental building blocks for all possible solutions:  The spectrum of an operator is used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) using spectral methods. We represent the solution to a PDE as a sum of basis functions, which are the eigenfunctions of a related operator. */
/* Spectrum, gives us information about the manifold's geometry, like its volume and curvature. For example, the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a circle are related to integers, while the eigenvalues on a square are related to the sum of squares of integers. The spectrum is a way to "fingerprint" the geometry of a space:  The spectrum of a compact Riemannian manifold is the set of eigenvalues of its Laplace-Beltrami operator. These eigenvalues are a geometric invariant of the manifold. */
/* Spectrum, particle jumping between a finite number of states. The transition probabilities are given by a matrix. The eigenvalues of this matrix tell us how quickly the particle's long-term distribution of states stabilizes. If the second largest eigenvalue is close to 1, it takes a long time to converge. If it's close to 0, it converges quickly. The spectrum is a measure of the "mixing time" of the chain:  The spectrum of the transition matrix of a finite state Markov chain provides information about its long-term behavior. The largest eigenvalue is always 1, and its corresponding eigenvector gives the stationary distribution. The other eigenvalues govern the rate of convergence to this distribution. */
/* Spectrum, a compact operator "squishes" infinite-dimensional spaces down to something resembling a finite-dimensional space. The spectrum of such an operator reflects this. The eigenvalues are countable and tend to zero. This is like a sequence of "stretching factors" that get smaller and smaller. An example is the integral operator T f(x)= integral of 0 to 1​K(x,y)f(y)dy for a continuous kernel K. Its spectrum is a sequence of eigenvalues converging to zero:  The spectrum of a compact operator is a discrete set of eigenvalues with accumulation point at zero. This means that a compact operator's spectrum behaves more like a finite-dimensional operator's spectrum than a general infinite-dimensional operator's. */
/* Spectrum, residual spectrum is a set of "bottlenecks." For a value λ in the residual spectrum, the operator (A−e I) maps different vectors to different vectors (it's injective), but it doesn't "fill up" the entire space, not even densely. There are "holes" in the image. An example is the right-shift operator on the Hilbert space l^2. The set of points inside the unit disk is its residual spectrum:  The residual spectrum of an operator A is the set of e for which (A−e I) is injective but its range is not dense in the space. */
/* Spectrum, convex body gives information about its curvature. For a sphere, the curvature is constant, and its spectrum is a simple set of eigenvalues. For a non-spherical convex body, the curvature varies, and the spectrum provides a detailed description of these variations. The spectrum can be a "curvature fingerprint" of the convex body:  The spectrum of a convex body can be defined via the eigenvalues of its Hessian of the support function. */
/* Spectrum, family of vibrating strings whose tension is slowly changed. As the tension changes, the frequencies of vibration change. Spectral flow counts how many times a frequency becomes zero. This concept is used in index theory to count the number of zero modes of a family of operators. It's like tracking the number of times a moving target crosses a fixed line:  Spectral flow is a concept from global analysis that measures how the spectrum of a family of self-adjoint operators changes as a parameter is varied. It counts the number of eigenvalues that cross zero. */
/* Spectrum, stationary stochastic process is one whose statistical properties do not change over time. Its spectral measure tells us how much "energy" or "variance" is contained in different frequency bands. A process with a spectral measure concentrated at low frequencies is slow-moving, while a process with a spectral measure at high frequencies is fast-moving. The spectral measure is like a power spectrum of the random process:  The spectral measure of a stationary stochastic process is a measure on the frequency domain that describes the distribution of power across different frequencies. */

/* Functional, Dirac delta functional δa​ is the quintessential example. It maps a test function ϕ(x) to its value at a single point a, i.e., δ_a​(ϕ) = ϕ(a). So the Dirac delta function turns a map into a point, like a reverse functor of points, as a map of a map. Geometrically, the Dirac delta can be visualized as an infinitely tall, infinitely thin spike at a point a, with a total "area" of 1. While not a true function, it acts as a functional that "picks out" the value of a function at a specific point: A functional, also known as a distribution or a generalized function, is a continuous linear map from a space of "test functions" (e.g., infinitely differentiable functions with compact support) to the real numbers. */
/* Functional, wave front set of a distribution, which is a key concept in microlocal analysis. A functional can be used to "test" for the regularity of a distribution at a specific point and in a specific direction. For example, a functional could be designed to "look for" singularities (discontinuities or non-differentiable points) in a distribution along a certain ray in phase space. The functional maps the distribution to a value that is nonzero if there's a singularity and zero otherwise: A functional in microlocal analysis maps a distribution to a value, and its properties are studied locally in both position and frequency (or direction). */
/* Functional, action functional in classical mechanics is a prime example. It maps a path (a function of time) to a single number, the action, which is the integral of the Lagrangian along the path. The principle of least action states that the actual path taken by a physical system is the one that minimizes or extremizes this functional. Geometrically, this means finding the "smoothest" or "most efficient" path through the function space of possible trajectories, which corresponds to a geodesic-like curve on the infinite-dimensional manifold: A functional is a mapping from an infinite-dimensional manifold (e.g., a space of functions) to the real numbers.
