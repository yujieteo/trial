/* (0,1)-category, preordered set:  this is exactly a preordered set, objects are elements, morphisms exist if and only if A is less than or equal to B */
/* (0,1)-category, poset:  becomes poset if there are two morphisms A to B and B to A, then A and B are same object. */
/* (0,1)-category, directed graph:  nodes are objects, edges are morphisms, there is an identity loop on every node, and the transitive path rule for graphs serve as the composition */
/* (0,1)-category, incident relation:  incidence relation of object */
/* (0,1)-category, subset ontology:  model subset relation on a set, morphism from A to B exists if A is proper subset of B */
/* (0,1)-category, logical implication:  Objects, logical proposition, morphism from A to B means A implies B. */
/* (0,1)-category, Boolean algebra:  one can think of this as a simplifed model of Boolean algebra without complements */
/* (0,1)-category, monoid:  Monoid is a (0,1) category with single object, morphisms are elements of monoid */
/* (0,1)-category, special functor:  category with functor to the category of sets and functions, functor maps morphism to single element */
/* (0,1)-category, terminal object:  every pair of objects has a terminal object (a product), and an initial object (a coproduct) */
/* (0,1)-category, closure properties:  identity and associativity axioms satisfy closure properties of preorder relation */
/* (0,1)-category, categorical logic:  Objects: propositons, morphisms are the proofs, which there can only be one if a proposition follows from another */
/* (0,1)-category, state machine:  objects, states, morphisms means one way transition from A to B */
/* (0,1)-category, dependency graph:  objects are tasks, morphism from task A to task B means A must be done before B. */
/* (0,1)-category, minimal structure:  minimal structure that still qualifies as a category */
