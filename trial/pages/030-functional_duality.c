/* Uncertainty principle, physical space and frequency space are dual: Change in position * Change in momentum >= 1 is a good start, but it only captures a portion of what the principle tells us. Consider for instance the following (deliberately vague) statements, each of which can be viewed (heuristically, at least) as a manifestation of the uncertainty principle */
/* Uncertainty principle, tradeoff between frequency and smoothness: imagine an oscillatory function that is band-limited (restricted to low frequencies) is featureless and smooth at fine scales, but can be oscillatory (i.e. containing plenty of cancellation) at coarse scales. Conversely, a function which is smooth at fine scales will be almost entirely restricted to low frequencies. A function which is restricted to high frequencies is oscillatory at fine scales, but is negligible at coarse scales. Conversely, a function which is oscillatory at fine scales will be almost entirely restricted to high frequencies */
/* Uncertainty principle, filtering for coarse scale behaviour: projecting a function to low frequencies corresponds to averaging out (or spreading out) that function at fine scales, leaving only the coarse scale behaviour. */
/* Uncertainty principle, number of degrees of freedom of a function is bounded by the product of its spatial uncertainty and its frequency uncertainty (or more generally, by the volume of the phase space uncertainty):  In particular, there are not enough degrees of freedom for a non-trivial function to be simulatenously localised to both very fine scales and very low frequencies. */
/* Uncertainty principle, coarse scale (or global) averaged behaviour of a function, one essentially only needs to know the low frequency components of the function (and vice versa):  Fourier decomposition explains this. */
/* Uncertainty principle, fine scale (or local) oscillation of a function, one only needs to know the high frequency components of the function (and vice versa):  Fourier decomposition explains this. */
/* Uncertainty principle, localising a function to a region of physical space will cause its Fourier transform (or inverse Fourier transform) to resemble a plane wave on every dual region of frequency space:  Frequency becomes drastically reduced. */
/* Uncertainty principle, the smoother a function is, the more rapidly decreasing its Fourier transform (or inverse Fourier transform) is (and vice versa):  Sharp drop in frequency since no high frequency components. */
/* Uncertainty principle, localisation operations in position approximately commute with localisation operations in frequency so long as the product of the spatial uncertainty and the frequency uncertainty is significantly larger than one:  Change in position and change in frequency can be though as some sort of abelian relation. */
/* Uncertainty principle, high frequency (or large scale) limit, position and frequency asymptotically behave like a pair of classical observables, and partial differential equations asymptotically behave like classical ordinary differential equations. At lower frequencies (or finer scales), the former becomes a “quantum mechanical perturbation” of the latter, with the strength of the quantum effects increasing as one moves to increasingly lower frequencies and finer spatial scales:  Don't understand this. */
/* Unceratinty principle, phase heuristic, on an interval in the real line, the linear phase x to exp(2 pi i f x) at a given frequency f in R behaves like a constant when exp << 1/R, but oscillates significantly when exp >> 1/R This is visually plausible if one graphs the real and imaginary parts cos(2 pi i f x),  sin(2 pi i f x) For now, we will take this principle as axiomatic, without further justification, and without further elaboration as to what vague terms such as “behaves as if” or << mean:  If the phase f(x) of a complex exponential exp(2 pi i f(x))  fluctuates by less than 1 for some x isn a nice domain (convex set), then the phase exp(2 pi i f(x))  behaves as if it was constant on the domain. If the phase f(x) of a complex exponential exp(2 pi i f(x))  fluctuates by more than 1 for some x isn a nice domain (convex set), then the phase exp(2 pi i f(x))  behaves as if it was oscillate on the domain. */
/* Uncertainty principle, a particle confined to a very small box. The wave function describing its position is highly localized. However, to "build" this localized wave function, one needs a superposition of many different momentum wave functions (plane waves with different frequencies). Thus, the particle's momentum is very uncertain. Conversely, a particle with a very well-defined momentum is represented by a long, oscillating wave that stretches across all of space, so its position is completely uncertain. The uncertainty principle is a geometric statement about the wave-particle duality: the more a wave is like a particle (localized), the less it is like a wave (a single frequency):  In quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously known with perfect precision. Mathematically, the position of a particle is represented by a wave function ψ(x) and its momentum by the Fourier transform ψ^​(p). The principle is expressed as the inequality ΔxΔp≥2ℏ​, where Δx and Δp are the standard deviations of the position and momentum measurements, respectively, and ℏ is the reduced Planck constant. */
/* Uncertainty principle, box function (a function that is 1 on a finite interval and 0 everywhere else). It has compact support, but it's not smooth—it has two sharp corners. Its Fourier transform is a sinc function, which decays like 1/∣ξ∣ but has infinite support. The uncertainty principle is the geometric statement that the "roughness" of the box function is reflected in the slow decay of its Fourier transform. If we were to smooth out the box function, its Fourier transform would decay faster:  The uncertainty principle can also be expressed as a trade-off between the smoothness of a function and the decay of its Fourier transform. Specifically, if a function is very smooth (e.g., C∞), its Fourier transform must decay very rapidly. Conversely, if a function's Fourier transform is compactly supported (band-limited), the function itself must be infinitely smooth. This is a powerful duality that connects regularity in one domain to decay in the other. */
/* Uncertainty principle, a phase space diagram, with the horizontal axis representing position and the vertical axis representing frequency. A pure sine wave is a point on the frequency axis, but it's infinitely wide on the position axis. A Dirac delta function is a point on the position axis, but it's infinitely wide on the frequency axis. A wave front set of a general distribution is a cloud of points in this space. The uncertainty principle is the geometric statement that this cloud of points cannot be a single point. If a singularity exists at a point x0​, it must have a range of frequencies (directions) associated with it:  Microlocal analysis provides a refined version of the uncertainty principle by analyzing functions and distributions in phase space (position and frequency). The wave front set of a distribution is a subset of phase space that describes the location of its singularities and the directions in which they propagate. The uncertainty principle is the statement that a point in phase space cannot be both in the singular support and have a singular frequency in only a single direction. The singular support must be "smeared out" in both position and frequency. */
/* Uncertainty principle, heat source that is a single point at time t=0. This is a Dirac delta function, which is highly localized in space but has infinite frequency content. As heat diffuses, the temperature distribution becomes a smooth Gaussian, which is spread out in space and has a limited frequency range. The uncertainty principle is the geometric statement that the "localization" of the heat profile decreases over time. The energy is conserved, but it is distributed more widely:  In semigroup theory, the uncertainty principle is manifested as the regularizing effect of a semigroup. For example, the heat semigroup exp(tΔ) acts on functions by convolving them with a Gaussian. This process smooths out the function. The uncertainty principle dictates that this smoothing (reducing high-frequency content) comes at the cost of spreading the function out in space. */
/* Uncertainty principle, a function on a line that is a short, finite pulse. Its Fourier transform is a function that is non-zero everywhere. It may decay rapidly, but it never reaches zero. This is a very clean geometric statement. Similarly, a function that is a pure sine wave is localized in frequency but extends infinitely in space. The uncertainty principle is the geometric statement that you can't have a function that's a "short pulse" in both the spatial and frequency domains:  One of the most basic forms of the uncertainty principle states that a non-zero function and its Fourier transform cannot both have compact support (i.e., be zero outside a finite region). This is a consequence of the fact that if a function has compact support, its Fourier transform is an entire function (a function that is holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane). An entire function can only be zero at isolated points unless it's the zero function, so it cannot have compact support. */
/* Uncertainty principle, function that is a weak solution to the Laplace equation, Δu=0. We might know that this function is in L2. The regularity theory for the Laplace equation tells us that this weak solution must be infinitely smooth. The uncertainty principle is at work here. The "physics" of the Laplace equation (the fact that a solution must have no local extrema) forces the function to be smooth, and this smoothness is a manifestation of the uncertainty principle: the solution has limited high-frequency content, so it must be "spread out" in a certain sense:  In PDEs, the uncertainty principle is a foundational concept in the study of solution regularity. For example, the solution to an elliptic PDE is often found to be in a certain Sobolev space. The uncertainty principle (in the form of Sobolev embedding theorems) dictates a trade-off: to have a solution with high regularity (which means its Fourier transform decays rapidly), it must be spread out in space. This principle is used in bootstrapping arguments to prove that weak solutions are, in fact, classical smooth solutions. */
/* Uncertainty principle, a probability distribution that is a sharp spike. This means the random variable is highly localized. The characteristic function of this distribution is a flat line, which has infinite bandwidth. This is a geometric statement: a distribution that is a single point in space is maximally "spread out" in the frequency domain:  In probability theory, the uncertainty principle manifests as the trade-off between the variance of a random variable and the "bandwidth" of its characteristic function (the Fourier transform of its probability density function). If a random variable has a small variance, its probability mass is highly concentrated. Its characteristic function, therefore, must have a large bandwidth. This is a fundamental concept in information theory. */
/* Uncertainty principle, set of transformations of a space. If two transformations commute (e.g., rotating a sphere and translating it), you can apply them in any order. If they do not commute (e.g., rotating and dilating), the order matters. The uncertainty principle is the geometric statement that the position and momentum operators do not commute, which means you cannot have a function that is "perfectly well-behaved" under both operations:  The uncertainty principle is a statement about the duality between two non-commuting operators, such as position and momentum. The non-commutativity of these operators, [X,P]=0, implies that they do not share a common set of eigenfunctions. This means that a function cannot be an eigenfunction of both operators, which is a mathematical statement of the uncertainty principle. */
/* Uncertainty principle, a function on a line. The number of "bumps" or oscillations you can fit into a given interval is limited. The uncertainty principle is the geometric statement that the number of "degrees of freedom" of a function (the number of independent parameters needed to describe it) is limited. You can't have a function that has a high resolution in both the spatial and frequency domains:  The uncertainty principle can be interpreted as a statement about the limited number of degrees of freedom of a function. A function's degrees of freedom are bounded by the product of its spatial uncertainty and its frequency uncertainty. This is a core concept in information theory and signal processing, as it relates to the number of samples required to perfectly reconstruct a signal. */
/* Uncertainty principle, an operator as a "blurring" filter. A function that is a sharp spike (highly localized) is passed through this filter, and the output is a smooth, spread-out function. The uncertainty principle is the geometric statement that the operator cannot make the function both more localized and smoother. The "smoothing" effect of the operator necessarily comes at the cost of "localization.":  The uncertainty principle can be seen as a statement about the properties of a compact operator. A compact operator often has a "smoothing" or "regularizing" effect. The uncertainty principle is manifested as the trade-off between the localization of a function and the localization of its image under a compact operator. */
/* Uncertainty principle, a solution to the heat equation. An initial condition that is a sharp spike is a highly localized function. Over time, the solution becomes a smooth Gaussian function that is spread out in space. The uncertainty principle is the geometric statement that the "smoothing" of the function is accompanied by a "spreading." You can't have a solution that is both a localized spike and a smooth function:  In the study of PDEs, the uncertainty principle is a foundational concept in the study of a PDE's solution regularity. It dictates a trade-off between the spatial localization of a solution and its smoothness. For example, a solution to a PDE that is highly localized in a small region must have a certain level of "roughness," while a very smooth solution must be "spread out" in space. This principle is a key tool in proving existence and regularity of solutions. */
/* Uncertainty principle, a sphere. The eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on the sphere are the spherical harmonics. The uncertainty principle is the statement that a function on the sphere cannot be both a sharp spike (highly localized) and a single spherical harmonic (a single frequency):  In global analysis, the uncertainty principle can be generalized to manifolds. It states that a function on a manifold cannot be simultaneously localized in position and have a limited range of frequencies (eigenvalues of the Laplacian). This is a deep result that connects the geometry of the manifold to the properties of the functions on it. */
/* Uncertainty principle, smoothness of f in the physical domain corresponds to decay of f in the Fourier domain, and conversely. (More generally, fine scale properties of f tend to manifest themselves as coarse scale properties of f, and conversely.):   */
/* Uncertainty principle, constant coefficient differential operators such as d/dx in the physical domain corresponds to multiplication by polynomials such as 2 pi i f in the Fourier domain, and conversely:   */
/* Uncertainty principle, frequency modulation in the physical domain corresponds to translation in the frequency domain, and conversely:   */
