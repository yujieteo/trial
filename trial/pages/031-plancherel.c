/* Plancherel's theorem, the space of square-integrable functions L2(R) as a Hilbert space. The Fourier transform acts as a rotation or a rigid transformation within this space. Just as a physical rotation preserves the length of a vector, the Fourier transform preserves the "length" or norm of a function. For a function like the Gaussian f(x)=exp(−x2/2), its Fourier transform is also a Gaussian, f^​(ξ)=\root(2π​)exp(−ξ^2/2). The Plancherel theorem says that the integral of |f(x)|^2 over the real line is equal to the integral of |f^​(ξ)|2 over the real line. The shapes of the functions change, but their "total energy" remains the same:  The Plancherel theorem, in the context of harmonic analysis on a locally compact abelian group G, states that the Fourier transform is a unitary operator from L2(G) to L2(G^), where G^ is the dual group of continuous characters. This means the Fourier transform preserves the L2-norm. */
/* Plancherel's theorem, a "signal" in the time domain, represented by a function f(t) in L2(R). Its energy is given by the integral of |f(t)|^2 over support being the real line dt. The Plancherel theorem says that this total energy is exactly the same as the total energy of the signal in the frequency domain, given by |f(omega)|^2 over support being the real line domega. For a simple square pulse function, its Fourier transform is a sinc function. The total area under the squared magnitude of the pulse is equal to the total area under the squared magnitude of the sinc function:   */
/* Plancherel's identity, operator P = −i d/dx​ acts on functions. Its eigenfunctions are exp(iξx) with eigenvalues ξ. These are not in L2, but the Plancherel theorem shows that the Fourier transform decomposes any L^2 function into a continuous "sum" of these eigenfunctions. The Plancherel identity norm of f in frequency square is equal to norm of f in dual space sqquared is an expression of this diagonalization, where the norm on the original space is a sum of norms of components (like an inner product), and the norm on the transformed space is the integral of the squared magnitudes of the eigenvalues, which are the components of the diagonalized operator:  In the context of the spectral theory of the differential operator P=−i d/dx​, which has a continuous spectrum, the Plancherel theorem provides the spectral decomposition of this operator. It says that the unitary map (the Fourier transform) diagonalizes P, transforming it into a multiplication operator by the dual variable f on L^2(R). */
/* Plancherel's theorem, a particle state can be described by its position wave function ψ(x), where wave function^2 is the probability density of finding the particle at position x. The total probability is 1, so integral of wave function suqared is 1=1. The Plancherel theorem ensures that the corresponding momentum wave function ϕ(p), which is the Fourier transform of ψ(x), also has a total probability of 1. It's a statement that the "total probability" of the particle being somewhere is invariant whether we measure it in position space or momentum space:  In quantum mechanics, the Plancherel theorem states that the position (time) space wave function ψ(x) and the momentum (frequency) space wave function ϕ(p) contain the same information and are related by the Fourier transform, which is a unitary transformation. The probability of finding a particle in a certain position range is conserved under this transformation to the probability of finding it in a certain momentum range. */
/* Plancherel's theorem, blob of heat on an infinite metal plate. The heat distribution u(x,t) at any time t is a function in L2(Rn). The Plancherel theorem guarantees that the total "heat energy," represented by the norm u(*, t)||^2​, can be computed equivalently by integrating the squared magnitude of its Fourier transform, ||u^(⋅,t)||^2​. This is fundamental to showing that the L2 norm of the solution decays over time, as the heat diffuses. The total energy in the system is decreasing, which is easier to see in the frequency domain:  In the context of solving PDEs like the heat equation ut​=Δu, the Plancherel theorem is crucial for using Fourier analysis. It guarantees that the Fourier transform is a tool that preserves the "energy" or L2 norm of the solution as we move from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. This allows us to prove stability and existence results for solutions. */
/* Plancherel's theorem, PDF f_X ​(x) tells us how the probability of an outcome is distributed. The Plancherel theorem relates this to the "spread" of the characteristic function ϕX​(t) in the frequency domain. For a normal distribution, both the PDF and characteristic function are Gaussians. The theorem says the total squared area of the PDF is proportional to the total squared area of the characteristic function. This is a powerful identity that relates the "concentration" of a distribution in the space of outcomes to its "concentration" in the frequency domain:  In probability, the Plancherel theorem is a version of Parseval's theorem for continuous random variables. It relates the expected value of a function of a random variable to the expected value of its Fourier transform. For a continuous random variable X with probability density function (PDF) f_X​(x), the characteristic function is ϕ_f​(t)=E[exp[ifX]]. The Plancherel theorem sttates the integral of the norm of the characteristic function ^2 / 2pi over frequency is the integral of f_X(x)^2 dx over outcomes. */
/* Plancherel's theorem, analysis uses the Fourier transform to study a function's "behavior" at a point and in a direction (the "microlocal" viewpoint). The Plancherel theorem is the guarantee that this transform is well-behaved and preserves energy. For example, consider a function that is localized to a small region. Its Fourier transform will be broad. The Plancherel theorem guarantees that the total "area" under the squared magnitude of the function is the same as the total "area" under the squared magnitude of its transform. The energy is conserved, it's just spread out:  In microlocal analysis, which studies functions and distributions locally in both position and momentum space, the Plancherel theorem serves as the foundational pillar for the theory. It's the statement that the Fourier transform is a unitary map, which is crucial for defining and analyzing pseudodifferential operators, which are built upon Fourier analysis. */
/* Plancherel's theorem, he real line R with Lebesgue measure, which assigns a "size" to sets based on their length. The Plancherel theorem says that the Fourier transform maps this measure space to another measure space (the dual space R with Lebesgue measure), such that the total "volume" or "size" of any square-integrable function is conserved. The total volume of a "blob" of probability on the real line is the same as the total volume of its transformed "blob" in the frequency domain. The measures are normalized so this holds:  From the perspective of measure theory, the Plancherel theorem can be stated as a relationship between Lebesgue measure on a locally compact abelian group G and Haar measure on its dual group G^. It asserts that the Fourier transform is an isometry between the Hilbert spaces L2(G,μG​) and L2(G^,μG^​), where μG​ and μG^​ are appropriately normalized Haar measures. */
/* Plancherel's theorem, Hilbert space, the inner product is a way to measure the "angle" and "length" of vectors. The Plancherel theorem says the Fourier transform is a "rigid motion" of the entire function space. It doesn't stretch or compress functions; it just changes their representation. For two functions f and g, the Plancherel theorem says their "overlap" (inner product) is the same as the "overlap" of their Fourier transforms:  Plancherel's theorem is a statement about the properties of the Fourier transform as a linear operator. It asserts that the Fourier transform F:L2(R^n)→L2(R^n) is a unitary operator, which means it's an isomorphism that preserves the inner product. That is, inner product of fg in L^2 is the same as inner produt of duals f^ g^ in L^2 for all f and g in L^2(R^n) */
/* Plancherel's theorem, function u0​ and let a semigroup act on it, such as heat diffusion. The Plancherel theorem allows us to transform the complex operation of diffusion into a simple multiplication by an exponential decay factor in the frequency domain. The total energy of the heat blob, ||u(t)||_norm2​, can be calculated by integrating the squared magnitude of its Fourier transform, which we know decays exponentially. The Plancherel theorem is the bridge that allows us to view the decay of total energy in the spatial domain as a simple decay in the frequency domain:  Plancherel's theorem is crucial for the spectral decomposition of semigroups of operators. For example, in the context of the heat equation, the solution operator T(t) u)0​=exp(tΔ)u_0​ forms a contraction semigroup. Plancherel's theorem allows us to analyze this semigroup in the frequency domain, where it becomes a simple multiplication operator, exp(−t∣ξ∣^2), which makes the analysis of its behavior much simpler. */
/* Plancherel's theorem, a compact manifold like a sphere. The eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator are the spherical harmonics. The Plancherel theorem for this case states that any function on the sphere can be decomposed into a sum of these spherical harmonics, and the total "energy" of the function is the sum of the energies of its harmonic components. This is a discrete version of the Plancherel theorem, where the "frequency space" is the discrete set of eigenvalues of the Laplacian:  In global analysis, Plancherel's theorem is a foundational tool for analyzing functions on manifolds. It is generalized to the study of the spectrum of differential operators on Riemannian manifolds, such as the Laplace-Beltrami operator. It's a statement about the spectral decomposition of these operators, which is a key part of the theory. */
/* Plancherel's theorem, a convex set K. The Fourier transform of its indicator function is related to the support function of the set. The Plancherel theorem says that the integral of the squared magnitude of the indicator function, which is the volume of the set, is related to the integral of the squared magnitude of its Fourier transform. This provides a link between the geometry of the set in the spatial domain and the "shape" of its Fourier transform in the frequency domain:  The Plancherel theorem, via the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, can be seen as a statement about the relationship between the volume of a convex body and the volume of its polar body. While not a direct application, the Plancherel theorem relates the size of a function to the size of its Fourier transform, and there are analogous results in convex geometry. */
