/* Haar measure, using length invariance under rotations to prove the Plancherel theorem: imagine the group of rotations of a circle, G = S^1. The Haar measure corresponds to the usual arc length measure. If you take a segment of the circle of length a and rotate it by any angle, the new segment will also have length a. The Haar measure is this notion of length that is invariant under all rotations. In the context of the representation theory of a locally compact group G, the Haar measure is a left-invariant measure on G that allows for the definition of the Hilbert space L_2(G). This measure is essential for defining unitary representations and for the Plancherel theorem, which describes the spectral decomposition of the regular representation. */
/* Haar measure, translational (read: group action) invariance: the group of real numbers under addition, G = (R,+). The Haar measure is the standard Lebesgue measure. If you take an interval [a,b] of length b - a and "translate" it by adding a number c, the new interval [a+c,b+c] still has the same length. This translation invariance is the key property of the Haar measure. The Haar measure on a locally compact group G is a non-zero, regular Borel measure m that is left-invariant, meaning m(gA)=m(A) for all g in G and all Borel sets A subset of group G. */
/* Haar measure, uniform distribution probability distributions on group of rotations of a sphere, SO(3):   The Haar probability measure on SO(3) corresponds to a uniform distribution of rotations. If you choose a rotation "at random," the probability of it falling into a certain region of the group space is proportional to the Haar measure of that region. This is how a spacecraft's orientation can be modeled as a random variable uniformly distributed over the space of all possible orientations. For a compact group, the Haar measure can be normalized to have a total measure of 1, making it a Haar probability measure. This measure represents the uniform distribution on the group, providing a natural way to choose a "random" element of the group. */
/* Haar measure, use in defining a family of distributions on a locally compact group:   Consider the Dirac delta "function" at the identity element of a group, delta_e​, can be seen as a distribution that "senses" a function's value at the identity. The Haar measure helps generalize this to other points. The convolution of a function with the Haar measure is a constant function, reflecting the invariance of the measure, For a test function p, the integral over G of p(g) dm(g) is a distribution, recall dm is a density kernel. The left-invariance of the Haar measure translates into an invariance property for these distributions. */
/* Haar measure, canonical measure of phase space: consider a group like SO(3), the phase space is the cotangent bundle. The Haar measure on the group, combined with a natural measure on the fibers of the cotangent bundle, gives a canonical measure on the entire phase space. This measure is invariant under left-translations of the group, which is a geometric manifestation of the group's action The Haar measure on the tangent bundle of a Lie group provides a natural measure for the phase space (cotangent bundle), which is the domain for microlocal analysis. This allows for the definition of the symbol of a pseudodifferential operator on the group. */
/* Haar measure, notion of volume to study invariant differential operators:  Consider the group U(n) of unitary matrices is a compact Lie group. The Haar measure on U(n) is a specific volume form. The integral of a function over the group with respect to this measure gives its "average" value. The Haar measure's invariance is reflected in the fact that this average is the same regardless of how we "shift" the function. On a compact Lie group, the Haar measure is a natural volume form. It gives a notion of "total volume" for the group and is a key ingredient in the study of invariant differential operators, such as the Laplacian. It is used to define inner products on function spaces, which in turn are used to study the spectrum of these operators. */
/* Haar measure, the heat equation on a torus (a compact group). The Haar measure is a multiple of the standard Lebesgue measure. The solution represents a heat distribution. If you shift the entire heat distribution to a different part of the torus, it will still evolve in the same way, because the underlying geometry and measure are translation-invariant:  In the context of solving PDEs on groups (e.g., the heat equation on a Lie group), the Haar measure provides the measure space for the function space where the solution lives. The left-invariance of the measure ensures that if a solution is found, any left-translated version of that solution is also a solution. */
/* Haar measure, a random walk on the circle. At each step, you take a small random turn. As you take more and more steps, your position becomes "uniformly" distributed over the circle. The Haar measure on the circle (arc length) is this uniform distribution. It's the "equilibrium" state for the random walk:  The Haar measure is used to define a random walk on a compact group. For a random walk where each step is a random variable distributed according to a measure on the group, the Haar measure is the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. This means that as the number of steps increases, the distribution of the position of the random walker converges to the Haar measure. */
/* Haar measure, a function on a Lie group. The Sobolev norm involves the L2-norm of the function and its derivatives. The Haar measure provides the volume element for this integral. The invariance of the measure ensures that the Sobolev norm of a function and its left-translated version are the same. This is crucial for studying the action of the group on these function spaces:  The Haar measure provides the measure space for function spaces used in nonlinear functional analysis on Lie groups. It allows for the definition of Sobolev spaces and other function spaces that are crucial for studying non-linear PDEs and variational problems on groups. The invariance of the measure simplifies the analysis. */
/* Haar measure, heat semigroup on a group corresponds to a convolution of an initial heat distribution with a heat kernel. The Haar measure is the measure used in this convolution integral. The left-invariance of the Haar measure implies that the heat kernel itself is invariant under left-translation, which means that heat diffuses in the same way everywhere on the group:  The Haar measure is used to define contraction semigroups on Lie groups, such as the heat semigroup. The heat kernel is a function on the group, and its evolution is a semigroup. The Haar measure provides the volume element for the convolution operation that defines the semigroup. */
/* Haar measure, you want to find the maximum value of a function on the group of rotations of a sphere. If you want to use a Monte Carlo method, you need to sample rotations uniformly. The Haar measure on SO(3) provides the correct way to do this:  While not a core concept, the Haar measure can be used to define a uniform distribution over a compact set in a Lie group. For example, one might want to optimize a function over the group. The Haar measure can be used to sample points uniformly from the group for use in a stochastic optimization algorithm. */
/* Haar measure, the group R and its subgroup Z, the quotient space is the circle S1. The Haar measure on R (Lebesgue measure) induces a measure on the circle (arc length). The length of any interval [a,b] on the circle is a measure of its size, and it is invariant under rotation:  The Haar measure provides a way to quantify the "size" of subgroups and quotients. For a closed subgroup H in G, a measure on the coset space G/H can be constructed using the Haar measure on G. */
/* Haar measure, a compact group acting on a sphere. The Haar measure can be used to define a uniform measure on the sphere that is invariant under the action of the group. If the group is SO(3), the measure is the standard area measure. This shows that the Haar measure is a source of invariant measures on homogeneous spaces:  For a topological group G acting on a measure space (X, m), the Haar measure on G can be used to define a measure on the space of orbits. In particular, for a compact group G acting on a space X, the Haar measure can be used to construct a G-invariant measure on X. */
/* Haar measure, Haar measure on a Lie group gives a notion of volume that is consistent with the group's structure. On the group R^n under vector addition, the Haar measure is the standard Lebesgue measure. The volume of a cube is invariant if you shift it. The Haar measure is the generalization of this to other groups:  The Haar measure is a special case of a more general concept of a measure on a manifold. On a Lie group, it is a canonical volume form, and it is a fundamental object in geometric measure theory. */
/* Haar measure, algebra of functions on a group with convolution as multiplication is a non-commutative algebra. The Haar measure is the measure used to define the convolution integral. It is essential for defining the inner product and norm that give rise to the Hilbert spaces on which these operator algebras act:  In the theory of operator algebras, the Haar measure is used to define the group von Neumann algebra VN(G) and the group C*-algebra C∗(G). These algebras are completions of the convolution algebra of functions on G and are central to the study of group representations. */
/* Haar measure, random variable uniformly distributed over a group has a certain amount of "randomness." The Haar measure provides the reference against which this randomness is measured. The more "volume" the group has, the more "random" a uniform element is:  Haar measure can be used to quantify the information content of a random element from a compact group. For a random variable uniformly distributed with respect to the Haar measure, its entropy is proportional to the volume of the group. */
/* Haar measure, a system on a torus. The Haar measure on the torus is the Lebesgue measure. If a dynamical system, like a flow, preserves this measure, it means that the "volume" of any region is conserved as the system evolves. This implies that the system is neither "contracting" nor "expanding" on average:  In dynamical systems, the Haar measure on a compact group can be used to define an invariant measure for a dynamical system. If a system is defined by an action of the group, and a measure is invariant under this action, it provides a tool for studying the long-term behavior of the system. */
/* Haar measure, a finite group, the Haar measure is the counting measure, assigning a measure of 1 to each element. The "integral" is just a sum. For a rotation group, the Haar measure gives a notion of "averaging" over all possible rotations, which is a powerful tool for studying the properties of the group:  In a purely algebraic context, Haar measure provides a bridge between abstract group theory and analysis. It allows us to perform "integration" and "averaging" over groups, which is a powerful tool for studying group structure. */
/* Locally compact abelian group, consider the circle group, S1, which consists of complex numbers of modulus 1 under multiplication. A neighborhood of any point on the circle, such as a small arc, is a compact set. The dual group consists of characters,which are maps of the form χ_k​(z) = z^k for integer k. The duality says that the group of these characters, Z, is the "correct" dual space for the circle: A locally compact abelian group (LCAG) is a group G that is abelian (the group operation is commutative) and also a topological space that is locally compact (every point has a compact neighborhood). The theory of LCAGs is fundamental because the Pontryagin duality theorem establishes a perfect duality between the group and its dual group of continuous characters. This duality is the cornerstone for generalizing Fourier analysis. */
/* Locally compact abelian group, abelian, locally compact real interval, and any closed interval like [a,b] is a compact set and serves as a compact neighborhood for any point inside it. The Lebesgue measure on R is the unique translation-invariant measure. The existence of this measure is what makes Fourier analysis on the real line possible:  An LCAG is a topological group G where the group operation is commutative, and the topology is Hausdorff and locally compact. This structure allows for the existence of a unique, up to a scalar multiple, translation-invariant Haar measure, which is essential for defining the Lp spaces and the Fourier transform on the group. */
/* Locally compact abelian groups, the group R acting on L2(R) by translation operators, Ty​f(x)=f(x−y). The Stone-von Neumann theorem shows that this family of operators has a spectral decomposition. The Plancherel theorem, which is central to this, says that the Fourier transform diagonalizes these operators, mapping them to multiplication operators on L2(R^), where R^ is the dual group. The geometry of this is a direct translation from a "spatial" shift to a "frequency" multiplication:  In the context of the spectral theory of operators, an LCAG is the underlying space on which a group of unitary operators acts. Specifically, for an LCAG G, its regular representation on L2(G) is a unitary representation. The spectral theorem for these operators relies on the structure of the LCAG and its dual. */
/* Locally compact abalian groups, heat semigroup on R is given by convolution with a Gaussian. The operators are shifts and scalings. The geometry of the LCAG is what makes these operators well-defined and allows for the application of the spectral theorem. The space is "flat" in a sense, and the shifts are rigid transformations:  An LCAG is the underlying space for the study of translation semigroups. A translation semigroup on L^p(G) is a family of operators that acts on functions by shifting them. The theory of such semigroups is fundamental to the study of PDEs like the heat equation. */
