/* Ultrafilter, formalisation of almost all i in I without using measure theory:  picture the natural numbers on the horizontal axis. A nonprincipal ultrafilter is like choosing one single “direction to infinity”: for every subset A of N, the ultrafilter “declares” either A is large (contains that direction) or its complement is large. Concretely, imagine a point p in the (compact, totally disconnected) space βN (the Stone-Cech compactification); that point determines which infinite subsets are neighborhoods of p — exactly the ultrafilter. Ultrafilters formalize the notion “for almost all i in I” without measure. They let you pass from sequences (a_i), for i in I​ to a single limit object (an ultralimit) by declaring equality/limit along U. This is the basis of ultraproducts, nonstandard analysis, asymptotic cones, and many combinatorial-algebraic transfer arguments. */
/* Ultrafilter, binary choice on every question about subsets: an ultrafilter is a collection of subsets of a set I i.e. ultrafilter U is in the power set of I satisfying (1) filter, closed under supersets and finite intersections; (2) for all subsets A of I, either A is in the ultrafilter U or the complement of A is in the ultrafilter of U. This ties into the ultrafilter answering questions about subsets. */
/* Nonprincipal ultrafilter, a direction to infinity that doesn't pass through any specific point, useful for defining the Stone Cech compactification later: an ultrafilter U on an infinite set I is a nonprincipal ultrafilter if it contains all cofinite subsets of the infinite set I (it contains no finite sets), formally, nonprincipal means it is not generated by a single element in the ultrafilter. */
/* U-large set, set that contains chosen direction to infinity:  a U-large set is a subset A of I  such that A is an element of the ultrafilter. */
/* Stone-Cech compactification, hold all possible directions to infinity as points:  unique largest compactification of a discrete space. The points of beta I are precisely the ultrafilters of I. */
/* Ultraproduct, declaring sequences equivalent if they agree on U-large set of indices, payoff is the hyperreals in characteristing first order logic and Los's theorem:  the quotient of the Cartesian product under the equivalence relation that sequences are equivalent if and only if the indices are equal, and this set of indices is U-large. */
/* Ultraproducts, collapses the enormous product into one object by “forgetting” small (non-U-large) disagreements:  Consider the cases of A_i= F_p,i (finite fields) or A_i = Z/nZ. Visualize each coordinate as a column of colored tiles (one tile per i). An element of the product is a whole tiling (a choice of tile per column). The ultrafilter draws a bold “selection lens”: two tilings are identified if they match on a U-large set of columns. The ultraproduct. Given structures (Ai)_i in I of the same signature and an ultrafilter U on I, the ultraproduct prod(i) to UAi is the quotient of the direct product prod_i (A_i) by the equivalence relation: (a_i)  equivalent to (b_i) if i is in ultrafilter I and a_i = b_i. Interpret operations coordinatewise on equivalence classes. */
/* Ultralimit, conclusion or value we get by agreeing that "almost all" of the sequence terms belong to any neighborhood of this value: An point x in a topological space is the ultralimit if for every neighbourhood V of point x, the index set of a_i in sequence (a_i), i is in infinite set I, a_i is in neighbourhood V is U-large. */
/* Mathematical structure (L-structure, model), type of mathematical object: M_i is a single mathematical structure indexed by element i, some examples include a list of all groups, all fields or all first model sharing a language L */
/* Los's theorem, ultraproduct inherits all first-order logical properties that hold true for "almost all" (U-large) of the original structures: A first order sentence phi_i is true in the ultraproduct if and only if the set of indices the set of indices for i in infinite set I such that premises of a mathematical structure M_i leads to semantic consequence (entailment of) first order sentence phi_i. */
/* Double turnstile, semantic consequence (entailment): you simply need truths to be preserved in all models, there are no remarks on provability. */
/* Single turnstile, syntatic consequence (provability): this is simple implication, if P is true, and P implies Q is true, then (the word then is where it is used) Q is true. */
/* Ultrafilters, identification combinatorial objects with topological dynamics: Picture N embedded as isolated points in a huge compact, totally disconnected space βN. Nonprincipal ultrafilters are limit points of sequences of natural numbers (but not in the metric sense). Concretely: pick subsets like the even numbers, primes, arithmetic progressions; a point p in βN is a consistent “choice” deciding for each such subset whether the neighborhood contains p. Geometrically, those decision-patterns create clopen neighborhoods that refine to the single point p. The Stone space of the Boolean algebra P(I) has points that are ultrafilters on I; for I being the natural numbers this is the Stone-Cech compactification βN. A subset A in N corresponds to the clopen set {p in βN such that A is in p}.  This identifies combinatorial objects with topological dynamics: idempotent ultrafilters in βN produce recurrence theorems (Hindman, van der Waerden). It is also the right setting for translating combinatorial statements into topological fixed-point-like theorems. This identifies combinatorial objects with topological dynamics: idempotent ultrafilters in βN produce recurrence theorems (Hindman, van der Waerden).  */
