/* Elliptic curves, smooth cubics with a group law: the most interesting part is that it has a group law in it, in the Weierstrass form it is a curve of the form y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. */
/* Torsion points, finite-order elements of the group: points such that n * point = origin for positive integer n. This is classified over Q by Mazur's theorem. The fact that torsion points exist is interesting. */
/* j-invariant, classifies isomorphic elliptic curves over C: it is given by this strange relation j(elliptic curve) = 1728 * (4a^3)/(4a^3 + 27b^3), This is already the easiest example of something moonshine like going on. Two elliptic curves over C are isomorphic if and only if they have the same j-invariant. */
/* Rational points, solutions in a given field: E(K) is the set of all points (x,y) in K^2 such that the points are on the elliptic curve union the origin. This forms a finitely generated abelian group by Mordell's theorem. */
/* Origin, point at infinity when you think what is unaffected by the group law in the chord and tangent process: define the identity of the group law by the point at infinity if you think about the chord and tangent process. */
/* Isogeny, nontrivial morphism preserving group structure: a surjective morphism f from two elliptic curves with finite kernel respective the abelian group law. */
/* L-function, turn point counts into product formula: consider ellipctive curve over the field of rationals, then the L-function L(E,s) is the product over prime p prod_p (1 - a_p p^{-s} + p^{1 - 2s})^{-1}, where a_p = p + 1 - rank(E(F_p)) over finite field F_p. This is because we used a Dirichlet series to get the L-function. */
