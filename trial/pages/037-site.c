/* Pullback, universal intersection: given morphisms f from X to Z and g from Y to Z, the pullback is a universal object P with projections p_x : P to X and p_Y from P to Y such that f * p_X = g * p_Y i.e. these projections are sections. The universal property means that for any other Q that maps to X and Y commuting over Z, there is a unique isomorphism from Q to P. */
/* Covering, using morphisms and relevant stability properties to generalise open covers to create sheaves later: using category, generalise open covers as a family of morphisms such that for any compatible local data on the moprhisms can be uniquely glued to U, these must satisfy isomorphism invariance, stability under pullbacks, and refinement (these are conditions for sheafification later) */
/* Grothendieck topology, open cover to define sheaves on categories: a Grothendieck topology on a category C assign each object U (glued) a family of morphisms {U_i -> U} such that isomorphisms are coverings, and coverings are stable under pullbacks and refinements, one can then sheaves on categories. */
/* Sites, categories that can be sheafified: a site is a category with a Grothendieck topology i.e., a specification of “covering families” for each object, such that pullbacks of coverings exist and coverings are stable under composition; it formalizes the notion of which collections of morphisms allow sheaves to be defined and glued consistently over category C. */
/* Stack, tracking automorphisms in objects using families: a stack is a category (often fibred in groupoids) over a base site (need sites to have coverings that track automorphisms) such that for any covering, objects and morphisms can be glued consistently, and isomorphisms form a sheaf; it generalizes moduli spaces by encoding both objects and their automorphisms, allowing a well-behaved notion of “families of objects with symmetries.” */
