/* CW complex, combinatorical construction for computation of homology and cohomology by induction: combinatorics mean induction, a CW complex is a topological space with a discrete set of 0-cells, attaching n-dimensional disks with continuous maps from the circle S^{n-1} to X^{n-1} where (n-1) skeleton X^{n-1}. The space is the union of all skeleta with the weak topology, a subset A in X is closed if intersections of A with X^n is closed in all X^n for all n. */
/* Chain complexes, algebra to capture modules with boundary like operators whose successive applications vanish: the definition is based on the principle that the boundary of a boundary is empty, a chain complex over a ring R is a sequence of R-modules connected by homomorphisms C_n to C_{n-1} such that the product of two adjacenet homomorphisms are zero. The homology is the quotient of the kernel ker(d_n) quotiented out by the image at d_{n+1}. */
/* Trace of a chain complex, alternating due to homology maps, generalising usual matrix trace: the trace of a chain complex is the alternating sum (comes from definition of homology) of the ordinary trace of chain maps on each degree. */
/* Lefschetz's fixed point principle, help traces encode information about fixed point: The Lefschetz number is defined as the trace of chain maps in homology with rational coefficients, the data input is a continuous map of a CW complex. The fixed point theorem states that if the Lefschetz number is nonzero, then the continuous map has a fixed point. */
/* Graph and diagonal of a finite CW complex, intersection theory of graph and diagonal corresponds to fixed points: this is the primary insight of why one constructs the graph. The intersection number of the graph and diagonal of the CW complex gives the Lefschetz number. Diagonal means fixed point. The graph of a space is simply pairs of (x, f(x)) such that x is in X, the graph is contained in the cartesian product X * Y, f(x) is in Y. The diagonal is the case where f(x) = x, so it is in the cartesian product X * X. */
