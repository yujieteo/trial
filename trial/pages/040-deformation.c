/* Family of schemes, parametric (base scheme) dependence in algebraic geometry, results are encoded in fibres pulled back to original scheme: idea is simple, you want a morphism of schemes to a base scheme S to vary over, the base scheme is the parameter to vary, so you want to pull back (get the argument that gets the result), so for each point in the base scheme (parameters), one considers the fibres X_s = X * Spec(k(s)) capturing the member of the family parameterised by s. Additional properties, especially flatness, properness or smoothness ensures good geometric properties captured by the fibre. */
/* Artinian k-algebra, suitable test objects since every descending chain of ideals stabilises: commutative k-algebra A of finite length as a module over itself, satisfying the descending chain condition on ideals. It has the unique maximal ideal such that the quotient of the maximal ideal with the algebra is isomorphic the residue field. Any small thickening of the field factors through these algebras, so these are designaed as the test objects. */
/* Flat deformation, conditions to avoid base change and geometric data jumps, nice local conditions (Artinian k-algebra), nice global glueing (schemes), preserving tensor (fibre) products: start with the nice local properties you want, in this case it is an Artinian k-algebra (descending chain condition), with residue field k. You are working over schemes. Then a flat deformation of a scheme over a local Artinian k-algebra A with residue field K is a flat morphism pi from X to Spec A together with an isomorphism where the fibre product of X *_{Spec A} Spec(k) is isomorphic to X. The sheaf of rings OX is a flat OSpec(A)-module, ensuring that Hilbert polynomials, cohomological invariants, fibre dimensions behaviour continuously */
/* Kahler differentials, linearising functions as tangent data of a scheme, module since you want vector space on these linearising functions, universal property since you want the univerasl derivation as chain rule: linearising is the only way we do algebra well, this motivates Kahler differentials. The idea starts from a chain rule d(ab) = a db + b (da) as the universal property you want to define, this is the universal derivation. We define a module of Kahler differentials for a k-algebra A such that for any A-module M, every k-linear derivation factors uniquely through the universal derivation. */
/* Dual numbers, easiest example of nilpotent (classic example is y = x^2) thickenings for deformation calculations: the dual numbers over a field is k(eps)/(eps^2) where eps is nonzero and eps^2 = 0, they form a local Artinian k-algebra with residue field k. A morphism Spec(k(eps)/(eps^2)) to k encodes infintesimal tangent vectors at point X (hint: you pullback to get the encoding) */
/* Tangent sheaf, derivations of structural sheaf encoding infinitesimal vector fields, Kahler differentials:  the idea is you want to consider derivations of the structural sheaf, start with the (sheaf of) Kahler differentials Omega^1 X over field k, the the tangent sheaf is the homomorphisms over the sheaf of rings Hom_{OX}(Omega^1 X/k, OX). This way, sections of the tangent sheaf over an open U are the k-linear derivations. */
/* Deformation, define tangent space and obstructions keeping niceness of flat deformations, niceness means you want a functor with derived functors as invariants: since this is a functor, you want to think about the categories of interest: the infinitesimal deformation functor Def_X is a functor that assigns each local Artinian k-algebra with residue field K the set of isomorphism classes of flat deformations of X over Spec(A). The tangent space of the first Ext^1(T_X, O_X) where T_X is the tangent sheaf of X, O_X is the NOT the sheaf of Artinian k-algebras of X, it is more general, just a sheaf of rings. We will visit the idea that the Artinian k-algebras are test objects in this space. */
/* Cotangent complex, encodes homologically all the infinitesimal deformations, taking Kahler differentials as a base, derived categories are nicer to work with than cohomology: homological algebra is typically considered on the first dimensional example to generated higher dimension examples like the obstruction space. Define for a morphism of schemes f from scheme X to base scheme S, the cotangent complex is an object in the derived category on the sheaf of rings D(O_X) such that the cohomology captures this pattern: the zeroth cohomology H^0 of the cotangent complex is the Kahler differential, the first cohomology H^1 encode obstructions, Ext^i of the cotangent complex with its sheaf of rings compute the tangent and obstruction spaces where i = 0 is infintesimal automorphisms, i = 1 is tangent space, i = 2 is obstruction space. */
/* Obstruction space, characterised by lifting: we saw how obstruction space can be naturally defined in terms of the derived Ext functors of the cotangent complex, its use in practice is the following: consider a small extension of Artinian k-algebras 0 to I to A' to A to 0, elements of the tensor product of Ob_X * I in the residue field k detects whether it can be lifted to A'. */
