/*Karpathy's ChatGPT prompts: be straightforward and get to the point. I love learning, education, explanations and insights.*/
/*Taleb on decay in tail risk hedging: convexity is equal decay, you need precision. The devil is in the heuristics.*/
/*Taleb on reasons to buy options: if you have any reasons to buy an option, for speculation only buy options when you have no reason to buy them. If there is a reason to buy it, it will be priced in.*/
/*Taleb on Schwartz distributions and generalised functions: theory of distributions can be simplified with an analogy to option pricing.*/
/*Taleb on nonergodicity of selling: no option seller survives this is because selling is nonergodic.*/
/*Tenobrus on performance impact of copies: performance impact on copies in C++ is very bad, removing full collection copies can improve a production codebase by 100%. Always turn copies into reference address.*/
/*<code>sizeof()</code> misconception: <code>sizeof(short)</code> is not the number of bits in a short.*/
/*Wrong ladder wall analogy in reading papers: most important thing is why am I reading this paper and what am I trying to learn and how long should I spent learning this. Focusing the scope save times because you are optimising the quality and value for effort. Sort papers into title, authors and keywords | abstracts and references | papers with key proofs or techniques. | entire papers | papers I can reproduce myself.*/
/*Math paper reading is nonlinear: one year to read one paper in intersection theory, constantly question, cross examine, take notes.*/
/*Numbers every computer architecture designer should know: examples include L1 cache reference, branch misprediction, mutex lock and unlock, these are used for back of the envelope calculation for a system design.*/
/*Topics in software development learn possibly: SQL, DB, Kafka/Redis/Docker, Linux, C, JS/HTML/CSS.*/
/*Spec R[x] as C modulo conjugation: it is a good idea that for any field k, the closed points of the affine line over k in dimension n is in bijection with the Galois orbits of the algebraic closure of k. Example, real valued polynomials have pairs of conjugate roots or purely real roots subsumed as one root. So Spec R[x] is Spec C modulo conjugation.*/
/*Neukrich perspective on number fields, by Qiaochu Yuan: rings of integers that are made algebraically closed have their singularities resolved.*/
/*Schur's lemman, one line proof: every endomorphism has an eigenvalue over the field and eigenspaces as subrepresentations.*/
/*Poonen's analogies in number fields and function fields: deep analogy here for Arakelov theory, look for the table by him.*/
/*George Hotz on compilers: compilers are not good enough to match English coding. Prompts are just bad abstractions.*/
/*System design algorithms: surprise! geohash, quadtree, consistent hashing load balancer, rate limiter leaky token buckets, tries, rsync, Raft, bloom filter, Merkle tree, hyperloglog, count-min sketch, hierarchial timing wheels job scheduler, operational transformation for collaborative editing.*/
/*Focusing and time: focus more of your time on what you want to see more of.

/*Information abundance leads to distortion: under 30 prematurely old worried about savings career and FIRE, over 50 is desperately young. Missed experiences.*/
/*Karpathy on blog posts and slides: don't write blogs, don't do slides, build the code, arrange it, get it to work.*/
