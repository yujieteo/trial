/* Homotopy type, description of how higher homotopies behave: for a topological space, it describes how higher homotopies behave. */
/* Etale homotopy, defining homotopy types: topological spaces have a homotopy type. Algebraic variety has no natural topology unless field is complex, using complex topology. How to define homotopy types? One can use etale site (category + etale covering maps) instead of open sets (topological space that has category and open covers mixed together). */
/* Etale site, category of etale morphisms: objects are etale morphisms, covers are etale families that jointly subject onto X. This is a Grothendieck topos since by definition it is a category of sheaves of sets on the etale site. */
/* Pro-homotopy type, definition of a topos: used to define homotopy types by approximating it with simplicial sets and then taking its homotopy type. */
/* Etale homotopy type, Artin and Mazurâ€™s definition: pro-homotopy type associated with the etale topos that is a Grothendieck topos since it is a category of sheaves of sets on a site. The etale homotopy type of X is a pro-object in the homotopy category of simplicial sets, such that for each finite etale cover, one associates a simplicial set of coverings called the Cech nerves, then take the systems of all these nerves orders by refinement. Formally, X_et := pro-hocolim_{U to X) N_* (U/X) where N_* (U/X) is the simplicial nerve of the covering U to X. */
/* Etale homotopy type, Friedlander: rigid homotopy type lives as a pro-simplicial set, behaves well under base change and morphisms. */
