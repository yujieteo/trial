/* Learning, media consumption: As for the basic premise of why even bother with anything but books,
   this is 2022. Everybody basically knows you cannot get away with
   just reading books to be an educated person. There is music, art,
   speeches, blogs, (social) media. Like it or not, one has to attain
   some mastery over all mediums of consumption in order to truly
   be educated (in the liberal arts sense) in this day and age.
   Of course, books are obviously a lot harder to enjoy. The hardest
   books to enjoy are definitely mathematics books but yet there are 
   many people who
   claim to be totally literate without even struggling with the
   madness that is mathematical literature. And hence this discussion
   would be about the extremes of the consumed media
   (with low and high OODA latencies) so as to inform a multi-pronged
   strategy for reading. */

/* Learning, Nyquist limit: 
The problem with staying plugged in all the time especially at lower
   information response latency is simply the Nyquist limit. Obviously
   if you want a holistic view of what people are doing day to day it 
   is practically impossible unless you live two days in a day. 
   This is also the same criticism I had on diaries. I want a complete
   view of what is going on and I am too stupid to extract useful
   insight based on a partial view of my day. */

/* Digesting ideas, OODA latency: To give yourself enough time to digest it all, I think that the
   plugged in turnpike at lower OODA latencies is practically impossible. 
   I also believe that this is the main issue people had with plugging in,
   and that the accusations of plugging out of this miss this point.
   These people are definitely absolutely okay with books. */

/* Digesting ideas, information medium: further, not everybody appreciates that people change based on 
   the information medium, and not all latencies match up
   to an appropriate medium. A stronger claim would be to say that
   to manage information flow, one must manage different categories
   of information at different latencies. For example, some sitcoms
   like Yes Minister represents a whole generation of experience
   and insider stories from the British Civil Service, and yet the medium
   is that of a so-called low latency TV. I do not think the graph is
   accurate. */

/* Digesting ideas, comments on merit of staying relevant on current events: 
   But I will admit that there is merit to staying current with live events
   since you do need an effectiveness to handle it properly. I have yet
   to find a satisfactory platform, the most satisfactory being Richard
   Stallman's political notes (collection of news so its in between
   hourly and daily frequency). There is the politically incorrect board
   on 4chan, but that I only treat as practice to keep myself sharp
   for high frequency low OODA loop latency news. I don't know of any
   reliable sources for high frequency events that are worth a lot of
   my headspace. This is ultimately what I think I should tune out off.
   For me, I eventually tuned out of modern music despite being
   brain food for ideas in our modern world at an exceptionally 
   high OODA latency. Modern music now is absolutely fabulous, 
   but I cannot keep up so easily since I love silence. */


/* Digesting ideas, TV and quality: 
  I will consider news blogs and TV (talk shows). But TV has gotten so
   bad recently. It is a problem with the medium, not the content. I hate
   irrelevant segments being put in in between talk shows.
   It is unclear whether fiction, dramas, or sitcoms fall under events
   or under ideas. My strategy right now is to do a mix of whatever
   there is when I have time to watch. I think news blogs are totally
   fine, and I have consulted many news blogs that carefully look at
   events. */

/* Digesting ideas, TV and quality, newspapers and magazines: 
   their writing is not very relevant to me.
   What do I mean by this? I mean that if I can predict the stance
   of the editors and the journalists and prove I am right after
   reading the article, what is the point? I now rely on people to tell
   me of controversial articles instead. I wish there was a source
   that gave insider view towards the category of premium mediocre minds. */

/* Digesting ideas, macro/long investing intelligence: 
   these are what Warren Buffett  reads most of the time. 
It is hard to get into, and I have yet to
   get into it but I am fine. In particular you can start getting into it
   with reference to the US government page on the form 10-K.
   College level education is great stuff. I love my textbooks without
   any pressure to do too well to learn about the world. */

/* Digesting ideas, historically informed books and non-news blogs: already form
   the bulk of my reading apart from textbooks since they have the highest
   information response latency and of course, who could forget that they
   are ideas! Ideas are not always great. In addition, I am adding fiction
   to this list. Too many people of my kind have been stunted by not reading
   enough fiction. To me, fiction is like vegetables. */

/* Digesting ideas, music as a counterexample: 
   another criticism of the turnpike which I have alluded to is that there
   are of course mediums like music (read: singing poems)
   releases which are early warning zeitgeist alarms but at an extremely
   low latency. Fortunately, fiction also falls under this category, but
   at least it is not too bad since there is a high information response
   latency. */

/* Digesting ideas, a possible strategy: 
   In summary, here is my ideal strategy if I could stomach it and stick
   to it with discipline: (1) real life people for day to day, (2) news blogs,
   read lots of them, and dramas/variety shows/animes on a very very limited
   selection (1 per type), (3) read interesting newspaper articles,
   skip boring ones, read scholarly journals, (4) read what Warren Buffett
   is reading, read textbooks, (5) compile a list of historically informed
   books on a reading shelf. I still have my anthology of literary theory
   to wade through to make sense of leftist activism (which I found very
   interesting, though I am not leftist), as well as compiling interesting
   non-news blogs. */

/* Digesting ideas, consolidation: 
   The one thing I can give credence to is if the stimulus is not interesting
   or different, then it is absolutely not worth reading. I think it is
   healthy to forget the irrelevant. I always go back to useful ideas
   that I picked up before to re-read. Pretty sure I am one of the few
   who likes to consolidate their few ideas more than to be a fox and
   pick up more and more ideas. */

/* Digesting ideas, reading books onlu: 
   I am also kind of suspicious of people who read too many books and not
   enough of anything else. The world's knowledge is too vast to cram
   into books, and what I found is that people are far more important
   than books. For example, I could not have possibly learnt
   parameter-concept based thinking without the help of my vibrations
   lecturer, or the concepts of using graphs to accelerate intuitions
   for a consolidated understanding from my aerodynamics lecturer.
   So, it is essential to prioritise people, and I do think in a place
   full of scholars even if they are terrible speakers and teachers,
   it is easier to learn from a professor terrible at teaching than it
   is to learn from a great teacher without as much subject knowledge.
   I do believe it is the rambling that helps consolidate these ideas. */
